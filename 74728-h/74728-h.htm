<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Col. Geo. G. Nasmith, C. M. G., Toronto</span></p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN, in August, 1914, war burst suddenly
upon a peaceful world like distant
thunder in a cloudless summer sky,
Canada, like the rest of the British Empire,
was profoundly startled. She had been a
peace-loving, non-military nation, satisfied to
develop her great natural resources, and live in
harmony with her neighbors; taking little interest
in European affairs, Canadians, in fact,
were a typical colonial people, with little
knowledge even of the strength of the ties that
linked them to the British Empire.</p>

<p>Upon declaration of war by Great Britain
Canada immediately sprang to arms. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
love of country and empire which had been
no obvious thing burst forth in a patriotic
fervor as deep as it was spontaneous and
genuine. The call to action was answered
with an enthusiasm the like of which had
rarely, if ever, been seen in any British
colony.</p>

<p>The Canadian Government called for 20,000
volunteers—enough for a single division—as
Canada’s contribution to the British army.
In less than a month 40,000 men had volunteered,
and the Minister of Militia was compelled
to stop the further enrolment of recruits.
From the gold fields of the Yukon,
from the slopes of the Rockies on the west to
the surf-beaten shores of the Atlantic on the
east; from workshop and mine; from farm,
office and forest, Canada’s sons trooped to the
colors.</p>

<p>It will be the everlasting glory of the men
of the first Canadian contingent, that they
needed no spur, either of victory or defeat:
they volunteered because they were quick to
perceive that the existence of their Empire was
threatened by the action of the most formidable
nation-in-arms that the world had ever
seen. They had been stirred by the deepest
emotion of a race—the love of country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>A site for a concentration camp was chosen
at Valcartier, nestling among the blue Laurentian
hills, sixteen miles from Quebec, and convenient
to that point of embarkation. Within
four days 6,000 men had arrived at Valcartier;
in another week there were 25,000 men.
From centers all over Canada troop trains,
each carrying hundreds of embryo soldiers,
sped towards Valcartier and deposited their
burdens on the miles of sidings that had sprung
up as though by magic.</p>

<p>The rapid evolution of that wild and wooded
river valley into a model military camp was a
great tribute to the engineering skill and
energy of civilians who had never done the
like before. One day an army of woodmen
were seen felling trees; the next day the stumps
were torn out and the hollows filled; on the
third day long rows of tents in regular camp
formation covered the ground, and on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
fourth day they were occupied by civilian soldiers
concentrated upon learning the rudiments
of the art and science of war.</p>

<p>Streets were laid out; miles of water pipes,
sunk in machine-made ditches, were connected
to hundreds of taps and shower baths; electric
light was installed; three miles of rifle butts
completed, and in two weeks the camp was
practically finished—the finest camp that the
first Canadians were destined to see. The
building of Valcartier camp was characteristic
of the driving power, vision and genius of the
Minister of Militia, General Sir Sam Hughes.</p>

<p>Of the 33,000 men assembled at Valcartier,
the great majority were civilians without any
previous training in warfare. About 7,000
Canadians had taken part in the South African
war, fifteen years before, and some of these,
together with a few ex-regulars who had seen
active service, were formed into the Princess
Patricia’s Light Infantry. Otherwise, with
the exception of the 3,000 regulars that formed
the standing army of Canada, the men and
most of the officers were amateurs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>It was therefore a feat that the Canadian
people could well afford to be proud of, that
in the great crisis they were able, through their
aggressive Minister of Militia, not only to
gather up these forces so quickly but that they
willingly and without delay converted their industries
to the manufacture of all necessary
army equipment. Factories all over the country
immediately began turning out vast
quantities of khaki cloth, uniforms, boots,
ammunition, harness, wagons, and the thousand
and one articles necessary for an army.</p>

<p>Before the end of September, 1914, the
Canadian Expeditionary Force had been
roughly hewn into shape, battalions had been
regrouped and remodeled, officers transferred
and re-transferred, intensive training carried
on, and all the necessary equipment assembled.
On October 8, 1914, thirty-three Atlantic
liners, carrying the contingent of 33,000 men,
comprising infantry, artillery, cavalry, engineers,
signalers, medical corps, army service
supply and ammunition columns, together
with horses, guns, ammunition, wagons, motor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
lorries and other essentials, sailed from Gaspé
basin on the Quebec seaboard to the battlefield
of Europe.</p>

<p>It was probably the largest convoy that
had ever been gathered together. This modern
armada in three long lines, each line one
and one-half miles apart, led by cruisers and
with battleships on the front, rear and either
flank, presented a thrilling spectacle. The
voyage proved uneventful, and on October
14th, the convoy steamed into Plymouth, receiving
an extraordinary ovation by the sober
English people, who seemed temporarily to
have gone wild with enthusiasm. Back of that
demonstration was the conviction that blood
had proved thicker than water and that the
apparently flimsy ties that bound the colonies
to the empire were bonds that were unbreakable.
The German conviction that the British
colonies would fall away and the British Empire
disintegrate upon the outbreak of a great
war had proved fallacious. It was, moreover,
a great demonstration of how the much-vaunted
German navy had already been swept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
from the seas and rendered impotent by the
might of Britain’s fleet.</p>

<p>A few days later the Canadians had settled
down on Salisbury Plain in southern England
for the further course of training necessary
before proceeding to France. There, for
nearly four months in the cold and the wet, in
the fog and mud, in crowded, dripping tents
and under constantly dripping skies, they carried
on and early gave evidence of their powers
of endurance and unquenchable spirit.</p>

<p>Lord Roberts made his last public appearance
before this division and addressing the
men said in part: “Three months ago we
found ourselves involved in this war—a war
not of our own seeking, but one which those
who have studied Germany’s literature and
Germany’s aspirations, knew was a war which
we should inevitably have to deal with sooner
or later. The prompt resolve of Canada to
give us such valuable assistance has touched
us deeply....</p>

<p>“We are fighting a nation which looks upon
the British Empire as a barrier to her development,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
and has in consequence, long contemplated
our overthrow and humiliation. To
attain that end she has manufactured a magnificent
fighting machine, and is straining every
nerve to gain victory.... It is only by
the most determined efforts that we can defeat
her.”</p>

<p>And this superb German military organization,
created by years of tireless effort, was
that which Canadian civilians had volunteered
to fight. Was it any wonder that some of the
most able leaders doubted whether men and
officers, no matter how brave and intelligent,
could ever equal the inspired barbarians who,
even at that very moment, were battling with
the finest British and French regulars and
pressing them steadily towards Paris?</p>

<p>In a short chapter of this kind attempting
to deal with Canada’s part in the Great War
it is obviously impossible to go into detail or
give more than the briefest of historical pictures.
Consequently much that is fascinating
can be given but a passing glance: for greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
detail larger works must be consulted. Nevertheless
it is well to try and view in perspective
events as they occurred, in order to obtain
some idea of their relative importance.</p>

<p>In February, 1915, the first Canadian division
crossed the Channel to France, and began
to obtain front-line experiences in a section
of the line just north of Neuve Chapelle.</p>

<p>While the first division had been going
through its course of training in England a
second division had been raised in Canada and
arrived in England shortly after the first left
it.</p>

<p>During that period the conflict in Europe
had passed through certain preliminary
phases—most of them fortunate for the Allies.
The unexpected holding up of the German
armies by the Belgians had prevented
the enemy from gaining the channel ports of
Calais and Boulogne in the first rush. Later
on the battle of the Marne had resulted in the
rolling back of the German waves until they
had subsided on a line roughly drawn through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Dixmude, Ypres, Armentières, La Bassée,
Lens, and southward to the French border
and the trench phase of warfare had begun.</p>

<p>The British held the section of front between
Ypres and La Bassée, about thirty miles
in length, the Germans, unfortunately, occupying
all the higher grounds.</p>

<p>Shortly after the arrival of the Canadian
division the British, concentrating the largest
number of guns that had hitherto been gathered
together on the French front, made an attack
on the Germans at Neuve Chapelle. This
attack, only partially successful in gains of
terrain, served to teach both belligerents several
lessons. It showed the British the need
for huge quantities of high explosives with
which to blast away wire and trenches and,
that in an attack, rifle fire, no matter how accurate,
was no match for an unlimited number
of machine guns.</p>

<p>It showed the enemy what could be done
with concentrated artillery fire—a lesson that
he availed himself of with deadly effect a few
weeks later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Though Canadian artillery took part in that
bombardment the infantry was not engaged
in the battle of Neuve Chapelle; it received
its baptism of fire, however, under excellent
conditions, and after a month’s experience in
trench warfare was taken out of the line for
rest.</p>

<p>The division was at that time under the command
of a British general and the staff included
several highly trained British staff
officers. Nevertheless the commands were
practically all in the hands of Canadians—lawyers,
business men, real-estate agents,
newspapermen and other amateur soldiers,
who, in civilian life as militiamen, had spent
more or less time in the study of the theory
of warfare. This should always be kept in
mind in view of subsequent events, as well as
the fact that these amateur soldiers were faced
by armies whose officers and men—professionals
in the art and science of warfare—regarded
themselves as invincible.</p>

<p>In mid-April the Canadians took over a
sector some five thousand yards long in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Ypres salient. On the left they joined up
with French colonial troops, and on their right
with the British. Thus there were Canadian
and French colonial troops side by side.</p>

<p>Toward the end of April the Germans reverted
to supreme barbarism and used poison
gas. Undismayed, though suffering terrible
losses, the heroic Canadians fought the second
battle of Ypres and held the line in the face
of the most terrific assaults.</p>

<p>When the news of the second battle of Ypres
reached Canada her people were profoundly
stirred. The blight of war had at last fallen
heavily, destroyed her first-born, but sorrow
was mixed with pride and exaltation that Canadian
men had proved a match for the most
scientifically trained troops in Europe. As
fighters Canadians had at once leaped into
front rank. British, Scotch and Irish blood,
with British traditions, had proved greater
forces than the scientific training and philosophic
principles of the Huns. It was a glorious
illustration of the axiom “right is greater
than might,” which the German had in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
pride reversed to read “might is right.” It
was prophetic of what the final issue of a contest
based on such divergent principles was to
be. So in those days Canadian men and
women held their heads higher and carried on
their war work with increased determination,
stimulated by the knowledge that they were
contending with an enemy more remorseless
and implacable than those terrible creatures
which used to come to them in their childish
dreams. It was felt that, a nation which could
scientifically and in cold blood resort to poison
gases—contrary to all accepted agreements of
civilized countries—to gain its object must be
fought with all the determination, resources
and skill which it was possible to employ.</p>

<p>Canada’s heart had been steeled. She was
now in the war with her last dollar and her last
man if need be. She had begun to realize that
failure in Europe would simply transfer the
struggle with the German fighting hordes to
our Atlantic provinces and the eastern American
states.</p>

<p>The famous Princess Patricia’s Canadian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Light Infantry was originally composed of
soldiers who had actually seen service and were
therefore veterans. Incidentally they were
older men and most of them were married but
the call of the Empire was insistent.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1914-15 the British line in
Flanders was very thin and the P. P. C. L. I.’s
being a trained regiment was sent over to
France several weeks before the first Canadian
division. It soon earned the name of a regiment
of extraordinarily hard-fighting qualities
and was all but wiped out before spring arrived.
The immortal story of this gallant unit
must be read in detail if one wishes to obtain
any clear conception of their deeds of valor—of
what it is possible for man to go through
and live. However, it was but one regiment
whose exploits were later equalled by other
Canadian regiments and it would therefore be
invidious to select any one for special praise.
After operating as a separate regiment for
nearly two years and having been recruited
from the regular Canadian depots in England,
it became in composition like other Canadian
regiments and was finally incorporated in the
third Canadian division.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>In the spring of 1915, a Canadian cavalry
brigade was formed in France made up of
Strathcona’s Horse, King Edward’s Horse,
the Royal Canadian Dragoons and Canadian
Mounted Rifles.</p>

<p>After the second battle of Ypres, the Canadians
after resting and re-organization,
were moved to a section of the line near La Bassée.
Here they fought the battle of Festubert—a
series of infantry attacks and artillery
bombardments, which gained little ground.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards they fought the battle
of Givenchy, equally futile, as far as material
results were concerned. Both of these battles
had the double object of feeling out the
strength of the German line and of obtaining
the Aubers Ridge, should the attacks prove
successful. In both battles the Canadians
showed great aptitude for attack, and tenacity
in their hold of captured trenches. They also
learned the difficult lesson that if an objective
is passed by the infantry the latter enter the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
zone of their own artillery fire and suffer accordingly.</p>

<p>In September, 1915, the Second Canadian
Division arrived in Flanders and took its place
at the side of the First Canadian Division, then
occupying the Ploegsteert section in front of
the Messines-Wytschaete Ridge. The rest of
the winter was spent more or less quietly by
both divisions in the usual trench warfare, and
battling with mud, water and weather.</p>

<p>It was here that the Canadians evolved the
“trench raid,” a method of cutting off a section
of enemy trench, killing or taking prisoners
all the enemy inhabitants, destroying it
and returning with little or no loss to the attacking
party. This method was quickly
copied from one end of the Franco-British line
to the other; it proved a most valuable method
of gaining information, and served to keep the
troops, during the long cold winter months,
stimulated and keen when otherwise life would
have proved most dull and uninteresting.</p>

<p>The Third Canadian Division was formed
in January and February, 1916. One infantry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
brigade was composed of regiments
which had been acting as Canadian corps
troops, including the Princess Patricia’s Canadian
Light Infantry, and the Royal Canadian
Regiment. The second infantry brigade
was made up of six Canadian mounted
rifle regiments, which had comprised part of
the cavalry brigade. These two brigades, of
the Third Division, under the command of
General Mercer of Toronto, almost immediately
began front-line work.</p>

<p>During this period, the Germans, making
desperate efforts extending over weeks of time,
did their utmost to break through the French
line at Verdun and exhaust the French reserves.
To offset these objects, a fourth British
army was assembled, which took over still
more of the French line, while a series of British
attacks, intended to pin down the German
reserves all along the line, was inaugurated.
One of these developed into a fight for the
craters—a terrible struggle at St. Eloi, where,
blasted from their muddy ditches, with rifles
and machine guns choked with mud and water;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
with communications lost and lack of artillery
support, the men of the Second Canadian Division
fought gamely from April 6th to April
20th, but were forced to yield the craters and
part of their front-line system to the enemy.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this the men of the Second
Canadian Division at St. Eloi fought
quite as nobly as had their brothers of the
First Division just a year before, at the glorious
battle of Ypres, a few miles farther north.
But it was a bitter experience. The lesson of
failure is as necessary in the education of a
nation as that of success.</p>

<p>On June 2d and 3d, the Third Canadian
Division, which then occupied part of the line
in the Ypres salient, including Hooge and
Sanctuary Wood, was smothered by an artillery
bombardment unprecedented in length
and intensity. Trenches melted into irregular
heaps of splintered wood, broken sand bags
and mangled bodies. Fighting gallantly the
men of this division fell in large numbers,
where they stood. The best infantry in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
world is powerless against avalanches of shells
projected from greatly superior numbers of
guns. The Canadian trenches were obliterated,
not captured.</p>

<p>By this time Britain had thoroughly learned
her lesson, and now countless shells and guns
were pouring into France from Great Britain
where thousands of factories, new and old,
toiled night and day, under the inspiring energy
of Mr. Lloyd George.</p>

<p>On June 13th, in a terrific counter-attack,
the Canadians in turn blasted the Huns from
the trenches taken from them a few days before.
The First Canadian Division recaptured
and consolidated all the ground and
trench systems that had been lost. Thus
ended the second year of Canadian military
operations in the Ypres salient. Each of the
three Canadian divisions had been tried by fire
in that terrible region, from which, it was said,
no man ever returned the same as he entered
it. Beneath its torn and rifted surface, thousands
of Canadians lie, mute testimony to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
fact that love of liberty is still one of the most
powerful, yet most intangible, things that man
is swayed by.</p>

<p>A very distinguished French general, speaking
of the part that Canada was playing in
the war, said, “Nothing in the history of the
world has ever been known quite like it. My
countrymen are fighting within fifty miles of
Paris, to push back and chastise a vile and
leprous race, which has violated the chastity
of beautiful France, but the Australians at
the Dardanelles and the Canadians at Ypres,
fought with supreme and absolute devotion
for what to many must have seemed simple
abstractions, and that nation which will support
for an abstraction the horror of this war
of all wars will ever hold the highest place in
the records of human valor.”</p>

<p>The Fourth Canadian Division reached the
Ypres region in August, 1916, just as the
other three Canadian divisions were leaving
for the Somme battlefield farther south. For
a while it occupied part of the line near Kemmel,
but soon followed the other divisions to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
the Somme, there to complete the Canadian
corps.</p>

<p>It may be stated here that though a fifth
Canadian division was formed and thoroughly
trained in England, it never reached France.
Canada until the passing of the Military Service
Act on July 6, 1917, depended solely on
voluntary enlistment. Up to that time Canada,
with a population of less than 9,000,000
had recruited 525,000 men by voluntary methods.
Of this number 356,986 had actually
gone overseas. Voluntary methods at last,
however, failed to supply drafts in sufficient
numbers to keep up the strength of the depleted
reserves in England, and in consequence
conscription was decided upon. By
this means, 56,000 men were drafted in Canada
before the war ended. In the meantime,
through heavy fighting the demand for drafts
became so insistent that the Fifth Canadian
Division in England had to be broken up to
reinforce the exhausted fighting divisions in
France.</p>

<p>It would be an incomplete summary of Canada’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
part in the war that did not mention
some of the men who have been responsible
for the success of Canadian arms. It is obviously
impossible to mention all of those responsible;
it is even harder to select a few.
But looking backward one sees two figures
that stand forth from all the rest—General Sir
Sam Hughes in Canada, and General Sir
Arthur Currie, commander of the Canadian
corps.</p>

<p>To General Sir Sam Hughes must be given
the credit of having foreseen war with Germany
and making such preparations as were
possible in a democracy like Canada. He it
was of all others who galvanized Canada into
action; he it was whose enthusiasm and driving
power were so contagious that they affected
not only his subordinates but the country
at large.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe45" id="i_022">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_022.jpg" alt="“TIME’S UP! OVER YOU GO!”">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p><small><i>Official Canadian War Records.</i></small></p>

<p class="caption">“TIME’S UP! OVER YOU GO!”</p>

<p>The word comes from the officer, watch in hand, “Time’s up! Over you go!” and instantly the men from the Dominion begin to
climb out of the trench. The picture shows the departure of the first of the three or more lines or “waves” that moves forward over
“No Man’s Land” against the enemy trenches.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Sir Sam Hughes will be remembered for
the building of Valcartier camp and the dispatch
of the first Canadian contingent. But
he did things of just as great importance. It
was he who sought and obtained for Canada
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>huge orders for munitions from Great Britain
and thereby made it possible for Canada to
weather the financial depression, pay her
own war expenditures and emerge from the
war in better financial shape than she was when
the war broke out. It was easy to build up a
business once established but the chief credit
must go to the man who established it.</p>

<p>Sir Sam Hughes was also responsible for the
selection of the officers who went overseas with
the first Canadian contingent. Among those
officers who subsequently became divisional
commanders were General Sir Arthur Currie,
General Sir Richard Turner, General Sir
David Watson, Generals Lipsett, Mercer and
Hughes.</p>

<p>Of those generals, Sir Arthur Currie
through sheer ability ultimately became commander
of the Canadian corps. This big,
quiet man, whose consideration, prudence and
brilliancy had won the absolute confidence of
Canadian officers and men alike, welded the
Canadian corps into a fighting force of incomparable
effectiveness—a force which was set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the most difficult tasks and, as events proved,
not in vain.</p>

<p>When Canada entered the war she had a
permanent force of 8,000 men. When hostilities
ceased on November 11, 1918, Canada
had sent overseas 418,980 soldiers. In addition
to this about 15,000 men had joined the
British Royal Air Service, several hundred
physicians and veterinarians, as well as 200
nurses, had been supplied to the British army,
while many hundreds of university men had
received commissions in the imperial army and
navy.</p>

<p>In September, October and November,
1916, the Canadian corps of four divisions,
which had been welded by General Byng and
General Currie into an exceedingly efficient
fighting machine, took its part in the battle
of the Somme—a battle in which the British
army assumed the heaviest share of the fighting
and casualties, and shifted the greatest
burden of the struggle from the shoulders of
the French to their own. The British army
had grown vastly in power and efficiency and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
in growing had taken over more and more of
the line from the French.</p>

<p>The battle of the Somme was long and involved.
The Franco-British forces were everywhere
victorious and by hard and continuous
fighting forced the Hun back to the famous
Hindenburg line. It was in this battle
that the tanks, evolved by the British, were
used for the first time, and played a most important
part in breaking down wire entanglements
and rounding up the machine-gun nests.
The part played in this battle by the Canadian
corps was conspicuous, and it especially distinguished
itself by the capture of Courcelette.
Although the battles which the Canadian corps
took part in subsequently were almost invariably
both successful and important, they can
be merely mentioned here. The Canadian
corps, now known everywhere to consist of
shock troops second to none on the western
front, was frequently used as the spearhead
with which to pierce particularly tough parts
of the enemy defenses.</p>

<p>On April 9th to 13th, 1917, the Canadian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
corps, with some British support, captured
Vimy Ridge, a point which had hitherto proved
invulnerable. When a year later, the Germans,
north and south, swept the British line
to one side in gigantic thrusts they were unable
to disturb this key point, Vimy Ridge,
which served as an anchor to the sagging line.
The Canadian corps was engaged at Arleux
and Fresnoy in April and May and was effective
in the operations around Lens in June.
Again on August 15th, it was engaged at Hill
70 and fought with conspicuous success in that
toughest, most difficult, and most heart-breaking
of all battles—Passchendaele.</p>

<p>In 1918, the Canadian Cavalry Brigade
won distinction in the German offensive of
March and April. On August 12, 1918, the
Canadian corps was engaged in the brilliantly
successful battle of Amiens, which completely
upset the German offensive plan. On August
26th to 28th the Canadians captured
Monchy-le-Preux, and, in one of the hammer
blows which Foch rained on the German front,
were given the most difficult piece of the whole
line to pierce—the Queant-Drocourt line.
This section of the famous Hindenburg line
was considered by the enemy to be absolutely
impregnable, but was captured by the Canadians
on September 3d and 4th. With this
line outflanked a vast German retreat began,
which ended on November 11th with the signing
of the armistice.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>To the Canadians fell the honors of breaking
through the first Hindenburg line by the capture
of Cambrai, on October 1st to 9th. They
also took Douai on October 19th, and Dena
on October 20th. On October 26th to November
2d they had the signal honor of capturing
Valenciennes thereby being the first
troops to break through the fourth and last
Hindenburg line.</p>

<p>It surely was a curious coincidence that
Mons, from which the original British army—the
best trained, it is said, that has taken the
field since the time of Caesar—began its retreat
in 1914, should have been the town which
Canadian civilians were destined to recapture.
The war began for the professional British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
army—the Contemptibles—when it began its
retreat from Mons in 1914; the war ended for
the British army at the very same town four
years and three months later, when on the day
the armistice was signed the men from Canada
re-entered it. Was it coincidence, or was it
fate?</p>

<p>During the war Canadian troops had sustained
211,000 casualties, 152,000 had been
wounded and more than 50,000 had made the
supreme sacrifice. Put into different language
this means that the number of Canadians
killed was just a little greater than the total
number of infantrymen in their corps of four
divisions.</p>

<p>The extent of the work involved in the care
of the wounded and sick of the Canadians overseas
may be gathered from the fact that Canada
equipped and sent across the Atlantic, 7 general
hospitals, 10 stationary hospitals, 16 field
ambulances, 3 sanitary sections, 4 casualty
clearing stations and advanced and base depots
of medical stores: The personnel of these
medical units consisted of 1,612 officers, 1,994
nursing sisters and 12,382 of other ranks, or
a total of about 16,000. This will give some
conception of the importance of the task involved
in the caring for the sick and wounded
of about 90,000 fighting troops, some 60,000
auxiliary troops behind the lines and the reserve
depots in England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>The work of the Canadian Red Cross Society
included the building and equipping of auxiliary
hospitals to those of the Canadian Army
Medical Corps; providing of extra and emergency
stores of all kinds, recreation huts, ambulances
and lorries, drugs, serums and surgical
equipment calculated to make hospitals more
efficient; the looking after the comfort of patients
in hospitals providing recreation and
entertainment to the wounded, and dispatching
regularly to every Canadian prisoner parcels
of food, as well as clothes, books and other necessaries:
The Canadian Red Cross expended
on goods for prisoners in 1917 nearly $600,000.</p>

<p>In all the Canadian Red Cross distributed
since the beginning of the war to November
23, 1918, $7,631,100.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>The approximate total of voluntary contributions

<p>As practically all of the increase of food and
other materials went to Great Britain, France
and Italy, the extent of Canada’s effort in upholding
the allied cause is clearly evident and
was by no means a small one.</p>

<p>The trade of Canada for 1914 was one billion
dollars; for the fiscal year of 1917-18 it
was two and one-half billion dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Approximately 60,000,000 shells were made
in Canada during the war. Shortly after the
outbreak of hostilities a shell committee was
formed in Canada to really act as an agent for
the British war office in placing contracts.
The first shells were shipped in December,
1914, and by the end of May, 1915, approximately
400 establishments were manufacturing
shells in Canada. By November, 1915, orders
had been placed by the Imperial Government
to the value of $300,000,000, and an Imperial
Munitions Board, replacing the shell committee,
was formed, directly responsible to the
Imperial Ministry of Munitions.</p>

<p>During the war period Canada purchased
from her bank savings $1,669,381,000 of Canadian
war loans.</p>

<p>Estimates of expenditures for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1919, demonstrated the thoroughness
with which Canada went to war.

<span class="smcap">The Second Battle of Ypres</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FIRST to feel the effects of German terrorism
through poison gas were the gallant
Canadian troops on the afternoon of April 22,
1915, at Ypres, Belgium. Gas had been used
by the Germans previously to this, but they
were mere experimental clouds directed against
Belgian troops.</p>

<p>Before the battle, the English and Canadians
held a line from Broodseinde to half a mile
north of St. Julien on the crest of the Grafenstafel
Ridge. The French prolonged the line
to Steenstraate on the Yperlee Canal. The
Germans originally planned the attack for
Tuesday, April 20th, but with satanic ingenuity
the offensive was postponed until between
4 and 5 o’clock on the afternoon of Thursday,
the 22d. During the morning the wind blew
steadily from the north and the scientists attached
to the German Field Headquarters predicted
that the strong wind would continue at
least twelve hours longer.</p>

<p class="caption">THE RED RUINS OF YPRES</p>

<p>Ypres, the British soldiers’ “Wipers,” was the scene of much of the bloodiest fighting of the war. Three great battles were fought for
its possession. The photograph shows what was once the market place.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>The Canadian division held a line extending
about five miles from the Ypres-Roulers Railway
to the Ypres-Poelcapelle road. The division
consisted of three infantry brigades, in
addition to the artillery brigades. Upon this
unsuspecting body of men the poison fumes
were projected by means of pipes and force
pumps. The immediate consequences were
that the asphyxiating gas of great intensity
rendered immediately helpless thousands of
men. The same gas attack that was projected
upon the Canadians also fell with murderous
effect upon the French. The consequences
were that the French division on the left of the
Canadians gave way and the Third brigade
of the Canadian division, so far as the left was
concerned, was “up in the air,” to use the phrase
of its commanding officer.</p>

<p>It became necessary for Brigadier-General
Turner, commanding the Third brigade, to
throw back his left flank southward to protect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
his rear. This caused great confusion, and the
enemy, advancing rapidly, took a number of
guns and many prisoners, penetrating to the
village of St. Julien, two miles in the rear of
the original French trenches. The Canadians
fought heroically, although greatly outnumbered
and pounded by artillery that inflicted
tremendous losses. The Germans, as they
came through the gas clouds, were protected
by masks moistened with a solution containing
bi-carbonate of soda.</p>

<p>The tactics of General Turner offset the
numerical superiority of the enemy, and prevented
a disastrous rout. General Currie,
commanding the Second brigade of Canadians,
repeated this successful maneuver when he
flung his left flank southward and, presenting
two fronts to the enemy, held his line of
trenches from Thursday at 5 o’clock until Sunday
afternoon. The reason the trenches were
held no longer than Sunday afternoon was
that they had been obliterated by heavy artillery
fire. The Germans finally succeeded in
capturing a line, the forward point of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
was the village of St. Julien. Reinforcements
under General Alderson had come up by this
time and the enemy’s advance was suddenly
checked. Enemy attacks upon the line running
from Ypres to Passchendaele completely
broke down under the withering fire of the
reinforced and re-formed artillery and infantry
brigades. The record officer of the Canadians
makes this comment of the detailed
fighting:</p>

<p>The story of the second battle of Ypres is
the story of how the Canadian division, enormously
outnumbered—for they had in front of
them at least four divisions, supported by immensely
heavy artillery, with a gap still existing,
though reduced, in their lines, and with
dispositions made hurriedly under the stimulus
of critical danger, fought through the day and
through the night, and then through another
day and night; fought under their officers until,
as happened to so many, those perished
gloriously, and then fought from the impulsion
of sheer valor because they came from fighting
stock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>The enemy, of course, was aware—whether
fully or not may perhaps be doubted—of the
advantage his breach in the line had given him,
and immediately began to push a formidable
series of attacks upon the whole of the newly-formed
Canadian salient. The attack was
everywhere fierce, but developed with particular
intensity at this moment upon the apex of
the newly-formed line, running in the direction
of St. Julien.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that some British
guns were taken in a wood comparatively early
in the evening of the 22d. In the course of
that night, and under the heaviest machine-gun
fire, this wood was assaulted by the Canadian
Scottish, Sixteenth battalion of the Third
brigade, and the Tenth battalion of the Second
brigade which was intercepted for this purpose
on its way to a reserve trench. The battalions
were respectively commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Leckie and Lieutenant-Colonel Boyle,
and after a most fierce struggle in the light of
a misty moon they took the position at the
point of the bayonet. At midnight the Second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
battalion, under Colonel Watson, and the
Toronto regiment, Queen’s Own, Third battalion
under Lieutenant-Colonel Rennie, both
of the First brigade, brought up much-needed
reinforcement, and though not actually engaged
in the assault, were in reserve.</p>

<p>All through the following days and nights
these battalions shared the fortunes and misfortunes
of the Third brigade. An officer who
took part in the attack describes how the men
about him fell under the fire of the machine
guns, which, in his phrase, played upon them,
“like a watering pot.” He added quite simply
“I wrote my own life off.” But the line never
wavered. When one man fell another took
his place, and with a final shout the survivors
of the two battalions flung themselves into the
wood.</p>

<p>The German garrison was completely demoralized,
and the impetuous advance of the
Canadians did not cease until they reached
the far side of the wood and intrenched themselves
there in the position so dearly gained.
They had, however, the disappointment of finding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
that the guns had been blown up by the
enemy, and later on in the same night a most
formidable concentration of artillery fire,
sweeping the wood as a tropical storm sweeps
the leaves from a forest, made it impossible for
them to hold the position for which they had
sacrificed so much.</p>

<p>The fighting continued without intermission
all through the night, and, to those who observed
the indications that the attack was being
pushed with ever-growing strength, it
hardly seemed possible that the Canadians,
fighting in positions so difficult to defend and so
little the subject of deliberate choice, could
maintain their resistance for any long period.
At 6 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> on Friday it became apparent that
the left was becoming more and more involved,
and a powerful German attempt to outflank it
developed rapidly. The consequences, if it had
been broken or outflanked, need not be insisted
upon. They were not merely local.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_041">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Town of Ypres Is Full of Memories for the Canadians</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was there decided, formidable as the attempt
undoubtedly was, to try and give relief
by a counter-attack upon the first line of German
trenches, now far, far advanced from those
originally occupied by the French. This was
carried out by the Ontario First and Fourth
battalions of the First brigade, under Brigadier-General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Mercer, acting in combination
with a British brigade.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that the youngest private in
the rank, as he set his teeth for the advance,
knew the task in front of him, and the youngest
subaltern knew all that rested upon its success.
It did not seem that any human being could
live in the shower of shot and shell which began
to play upon the advancing troops. They suffered
terrible casualties. For a short time
every other man seemed to fall, but the attack
was pressed ever closer and closer.</p>

<p>The Fourth Canadian battalion at one moment
came under a particularly withering fire.
For a moment—not more—it wavered. Its
most gallant commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel
Burchill, carrying, after an old fashion,
a light cane, coolly and cheerfully rallied
his men and, at the very moment when his example
had infected them, fell dead at the head
of his battalion. With a hoarse cry of anger
they sprang forward (for, indeed they loved
him), as if to avenge his death. The astonishing
attack which followed—pushed home in
the face of direct frontal fire made in broad
daylight by battalions whose names should live
forever in the memories of soldiers—was carried
to the front line of the German trenches.
After a hand-to-hand struggle the last German
who resisted was bayoneted, and the
trench was won.</p>

<p class="caption">A FIGHT IN A CLOUD OF GAS</p>

<p>The Germans had sent over gas and in this spot it lingered. Then the infantry advanced and here, amid the British wire entanglements,
the foes meet. Both sides in gas masks, they struggle amid the poisonous vapor, and when the bayonet fails they fight, like
the pair in the foreground, to bring death by tearing away their opponent’s mask.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>The measure of this success may be taken
when it is pointed out that this trench represented
in the German advance the apex in the
breach which the enemy had made in the original
line of the Allies, and that it was two and
a half miles south of that line. This charge,
made by men who looked death indifferently
in the face (for no man who took part in it
could think that he was likely to live) saved,
and that was much, the Canadian left. But it
did more. Up to the point where the assailants
conquered, or died, it secured and maintained
during the most critical moment of all the integrity
of the allied line. For the trench was
not only taken, it was held thereafter against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
all comers, and in the teeth of every conceivable
projectile, until the night of Sunday, the
25th, when all that remained of the war-broken
but victorious battalion was relieved by fresh
troops.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<span class="smcap">Murders and Martyrs</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MANY examples might be cited to show
that the Central empires were dead to
the humanities. There were apparently no
limits to the brutality of the German war-makers.
Among the outstanding deeds of the
Teutons that sickened the world was the killing
of Miss Edith Cavell, an English nurse
working in Belgian hospitals.</p>

<p>A shudder of horror circled the world when
announcement was formally made that this
splendid woman was sentenced to death and
murdered by a German firing squad at two
o’clock on the morning of October 12, 1915.</p>

<p>The killing of this gentle-natured, brave
woman typified to the world Germany’s essentially
brutal militarism. It placed the German
military command in a niche of dishonor
unique in all history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>The specific charge against Miss Cavell was
that she had helped English and French soldiers
and Belgian young male civilians to cross
the border into Holland. The direct evidence
against her was in the form of letters intercepted
by the Germans in which some of these
soldiers and civilians writing from England
thanked her for the aid she had given to
them.</p>

<p>Upon the farcical trial that resulted in the
predetermined sentence of death, Miss Cavell
courageously and freely admitted her assistance
in the specified cases of escape. When
she was asked why she did it, she declared her
fear that if she had not done so the men would
have been shot by the Germans. Her testimony
was given in a clear conversational tone
that betrayed no nervousness and her entire
bearing was such as to win the sympathy of
everyone except her stony-hearted judges.</p>

<p>The German officers in command at Brussels
made it impossible for Miss Cavell to see
counsel before the trial, and a number of able
lawyers who were solicited to undertake her
defense declined to do so because of their fear
of the Germans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>Sentence was imposed upon her at five
o’clock on the afternoon of October 11th. In
accordance with its terms, she was taken from
her cell and placed against a blank wall at two
o’clock the following morning—the darkness
of the hour vying with the blackness of the
deed. Mr. Gahan, the English clergyman
connected with the prison, was permitted to see
her a short time before her murder. He gave
her Holy Communion at ten o’clock on the
night of October 11th. To him she declared
she was happy in her contemplation of death;
that she had no regret for what she had done;
and that she was glad to die for her country.</p>

<p>Brand Whitlock, American Minister to Belgium,
and Hugh Gibson, Secretary of the
Legation, did all that was humanly possible
to avert the crime, but without avail. They
were told that, “the Emperor himself could
not intervene.”</p>

<p>Defending the murder, Dr. Alfred Zimmermann,
German Under-Secretary for Foreign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Affairs, callously disposed of the matter thus:</p>

<p>“I see from the English and American press
that the shooting of an Englishwoman and
the condemnation of several other women in
Brussels for treason has caused a sensation,
and capital against us is being made out of
the fact. It is undoubtedly a terrible thing
that the woman has been executed; but consider
what would happen to a state, particularly
in war, if it left crimes aimed at the safety
of its armies to go unpunished because committed
by women. No criminal code in the world—least
of all the laws of war—makes such a
distinction; and the feminine sex has but one
preference, according to legal usages, namely,
that women in a delicate condition may not be
executed. Otherwise man and woman are
equal before the law, and only the degree of
guilt makes a difference in the sentence for
the crime and its consequences.”</p>

<p>In reply to Dr. Zimmermann, statesmen
throughout the civilized world declared that it
was not merely a political mistake, not merely
a national blunder, to kill Miss Cavell, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
that it was a crime unjustified by the facts.
These statements were entirely outside of the
humanitarian aspect of the case; outside of the
promptings of manhood to show clemency toward
a woman whose actions had been inspired
by the loftiest sympathies and emotions.</p>

<p>Monuments to Edith Cavell were reared in
widely scattered communities. A mountain
was named in her honor. Her murder multiplied
enlistments and fed the fires of patriotism
throughout the Allied countries. In the
end, Germany lost heavily. The Teutons
aimed to strike terror into the hearts of men
and women. They only succeeded in arousing
a righteous anger that ultimately destroyed
the Imperial government.</p>

<p>Another instance equally flagrant of the
utter callousness of the men who at that time
ruled Germany, was the murder of Captain
Fryatt, a gallant British seaman, who had
dared to attack the pirates of the under-seas.</p>

<p>Captain Charles Fryatt was the master of
the steamship Brussels, a merchant vessel
owned by the Great Eastern Railway. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
captured by the Germans on June 23, 1916.
Captain Fryatt was taken to Zeebrugge. A
court-martial went through the motions of a
trial at Bruges on July 27th. The charge
against Captain Fryatt was that of attempting
to ram the German submarine U-33.</p>

<p>Mute testimony against Captain Fryatt was
a gold watch found upon his person. This
carried an inscription testifying that the watch
had been presented by the mayor and people
of Harwich in recognition of the Captain’s
bravery in attempting to ram a submarine, and
his successful escape when the U-boat called
upon him to surrender.</p>

<p>The prisoners who were captured with Captain
were sent to the prison camp at
Ruhlaben, but Captain Fryatt was condemned
to death as a “franc-tireur.” The news of the
murder was sent to the world through a German
communiqué dated July 28th. It stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The accused was condemned to death because, although
he was not a member of a combatant force, he
made an attempt on the afternoon of March 20, 1915,
to ram the German submarine U-33 near the Maas
lightship. The accused, as well as the first officer and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
the chief engineer of the steamer, received at the time
from the British Admiralty a gold watch as a reward
of his brave conduct on that occasion, and his action
was mentioned with praise in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>On the occasion in question, disregarding the U-boat’s
signal to stop and show his national flag, he turned at
a critical moment at high speed on the submarine, which
escaped the steamer by a few meters only by immediately
diving. He confessed that in so doing he had acted in
accordance with the instructions of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>One of the many nefarious franc-tireur proceedings
of the British merchant marine against our war vessels
has thus found a belated but merited expiation.</p>
</div>

<p>This brutal action by Germany coming after
the murder of Edith Cavell created intense indignation
throughout the world. It ranked
with the poison gas at Ypres, the Lusitania,
the Belgian atrocities, the killing of Edith
Cavell and the unrestricted submarine sinkings,
as a factor in arousing the democratic
peoples of the world to a fighting pitch.</p>

<p>The world will not soon forget these martyrs
to a splendid cause; and it will be many a long
year before the stain on the German peoples
who tolerated these crimes can be wiped out.</p>

<p>Germany sowed its seeds of destruction in
the wind that bore the fumes of poison gas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
and in the ruthless brutality that decreed the
sinking of the Lusitania and the murders of
Edith Cavell and Captain Fryatt.</p>

<p>It reaped the whirlwind in the world-wide
wrath that brought America into the war, and
that visited disgrace and defeat upon the German
Empire.</p>

<span class="smcap">Zeppelin Raids on France and England</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE idea of warfare in the air has been a
dream of romancers from a period long
before Jules Verne. Indeed, balloons were
used for observation purposes in the eighteenth
century by the French armies. The crude balloon
of that period, in a more developed form,
was used in the Franco-Prussian War, and
during the siege of Paris by its assistance communication
was kept up between Paris and the
outside world. Realizing its possibilities inventors
had been trying to develop a balloon
which could be propelled against the wind and
so guided that explosives could be dropped
upon a hostile army. Partially successful
dirigible balloons have been occasionally exhibited
for a number of years.</p>

<p>The idea of such a balloon took a strong hold
upon the imagination of the German army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
staff long before the Great War, and Count
Ferdinand Zeppelin gave the best years of his
life to its development. From the beginning
he met with great difficulties. His first ships
proved mechanical failures, and after these difficulties
were overcome he met with a series of
accidents which almost put an end to his efforts.
By popular subscription, and by government
support, he was able to continue, and
when the war began Germany had thirty-five
dirigible balloons of the Zeppelin and other
types, many of them as much as 490 feet long.</p>

<p>The Zeppelin balloon, called the Zeppelin
from the name of its inventor, was practically
a vast ship, capable of carrying a load of about
fifteen thousand pounds. It would carry a
crew of twenty men or more, fuel for the engines,
provisions, a wireless installation, and
armament with ammunition. For a journey
of twenty hours such a vessel would need at
least seven thousand pounds of fuel. It would
probably be able to carry about two tons
of explosives. These Zeppelins could travel
great distances. Before the war one of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
flew from Lake Constance to Berlin, a continuous
flight of about one thousand miles, in
thirty-one hours.</p>

<p>These great aerial warships were given a
thorough trial by the Germans. They disliked
to admit that they had made a costly
mistake in adding them to their armament. It
soon turned out, however, that the Zeppelins
were practically useless in battle. Whatever
they could do, either for scouting purposes or
in dropping explosives behind the enemy’s
lines, could be better done by the airplane.
The French and the English, who before the
war had decided that the airplane was the more
important weapon, were right. But the Germans
did not give up their costly toy so easily,
and they determined to use it in the bombardment
of cities and districts situated far away
from the German line, in dropping bombs,
not upon fortifications, or armed camps where
they might meet with resistance, but upon
peaceful non-belligerents in the streets of great
unfortified cities.</p>

<p>It was their policy of frightfulness once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
again. And once again they had made a mistake.
The varied expeditions of the Zeppelin
airships sent from Germany to bombard
Paris, or to cross the Channel and, after dropping
bombs on seaside resorts to wander over
the city of London in the hope of spreading
destruction there, did little real damage and
their net effects, from a military point of view,
were practically nil.</p>

<p>The first Zeppelin raid upon England took
place on January 19, 1915. The Zeppelins
passed over the cities of Yarmouth, Cromer,
Sherringham and King’s Lynn. On this expedition
there were two Zeppelins. They
reached the coast of Norfolk about 8:30 in the
evening and then steered northwest across the
country toward King’s Lynn, dropping bombs
as they went. In these towns there were no
military stations and the damage suffered was
very slight. Nine persons were killed, all
civilians. This raid was followed by many
others, which at first usually wasted their ammunition,
dropping their bombs on small country
towns or in empty fields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>On the 31st of May an expedition reached
London and killed six persons in the east end.
The result of this raid was to stir the English
to intense indignation. Mobs gathered in the
London streets, and persons suspected of being
Germans, or with German sympathies,
were attacked. Other raids followed, none of
them doing serious military damage, but usually
killing or wounding innocent non-combatants.
The stupid policy of secrecy which they
maintained during the first year of the war
unfortunately permitted great exaggeration
of the real damages which they had suffered.</p>

<p>During the first year, according to Mr. Balfour,
in eighteen Zeppelin raids there were
only seventy-one civilian adults and eighteen
children killed, one hundred and eighty-nine
civilian adults and thirty-one children wounded.
No soldier or sailor was killed and only seven
wounded.</p>

<p>In France similar attacks had been made on
Paris and Calais. On the 20th of March two
Zeppelins dropped bombs on Paris, but Paris,
unlike London, was a fortified city, and the sky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
soldiers were driven off by the anti-aircraft
guns. The French also devised an efficient
method of defense. On the appearance of an
airship great searchlights flashed into the air
and the enemy was made at once a target, not
only for the guns of all the forts, but also for
airplane attack. In order to attack successfully
a Zeppelin it was necessary that an airplane
should attain a position above the enemy.
For an airplane to rise to such a height time
was required, as the airplane rises slowly.
The French, therefore, devised a scheme by
which two or more airplanes were kept constantly
circling at a very great height above
the city. Relays were formed which relieved
each other at regular intervals. When an airship
approached it would therefore be compelled
in the first place to pass through the fire
of the guns on the great forts, and then would
find in the air above airplanes in waiting. The
Germans, therefore, practically gave up attacks
upon Paris. They were dangerous.</p>

<p>Observation post fitted with instruments for gauging the height and speed of

the outskirts of Paris.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>London, practically unarmed, seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
them an easy mark. But the British Lion was
now awake. The English had been taken by
surprise. They attempted at first, in an unorganized
way, to protect their city, and, though
occasionally successful in destroying an airship
through the gallantry of some individual
hero, they soon found that their defense must
be organized, and Admiral Sir Percy Scott
was entrusted with the task. Regulations
were introduced whose object was to darken
London. Lights were extinguished on the
streets and screened on the waterfront. Illumination
for advertising purposes was forbidden;
windows were covered, so that London
became at night a mass of gloom. The Zeppelins,
compelled to fly at a very great height,
because of anti-aircraft guns, were blinded.
As in Paris airplanes were constantly kept on
the alert and searchlights and anti-airship
guns placed at every convenient point.</p>

<p>The suggestion was made that the English
should undertake reprisals, but the suggestion
was strongly opposed on the ground that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
British should not be a “party to a line of conduct
condemned by every right-thinking man
of every civilized nation.”</p>

<p>The effect of the English improved defenses
was soon obvious, when the German expeditions
began to lose airship after airship. Under
the new régime, when such an attack was
signaled, the whole city immediately received
warning and the sky was swept by dozens of
searchlights. Safe retreats were ready for
those who cared to use them, but ordinarily
the whole population rushed out to watch the
spectacle. Airplanes would dash at the incoming
foe; the searchlights would be switched
off and the guns be silent to avoid hindering
the aviators. Then would come the attack and
Zeppelin after Zeppelin would be seen falling,
a great mass of flames, while their companions
would hurry back across the Channel. Even
there they would not be safe, for many an airship
was brought down on English fields, or on
the waters of the sea.</p>

<p>The Germans, however, did not confine
their policy of frightfulness in the air to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
performances of their Zeppelins. Before
the Zeppelins had crossed the Channel their
airplanes had visited England. On Christmas
Day, 1914, an airplane attacked Dover,
doing, however, no damage. Other airplanes
also visited the British Isles from time to time,
dropping bombs, and as the Germans began to
lose faith in the efficacy of their Zeppelin fleets
they began more and more to substitute airplanes
for their airships.</p>

<p>On some of these expeditions much more
damage was done than had ever been done by
the Zeppelins. The airplane expedition grew
serious in the year 1917; between May 23d and
June 16th of that year there were five such
aerial attacks. The airplanes could not only
move with greater speed but with better direction.
An attack on May 25th resulted in the
killing of seventy-six persons and the injuring
of one hundred and seventy-four, the principal
victims being women and children. This was
at the town of Folkestone on the southeast coast.
In this attack there were about sixteen airplanes,
and the time of the attack was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
more than three minutes. Scarcely any part
of Folkestone escaped injury. The attack
was methodically organized. Four separate
squadrons passed over the city, following each
other at short intervals. It was impossible to
tell when the attack would end, and people in
shelters or cellars were kept waiting for hours
without being able to feel certain that the
danger had passed.</p>

<p>It is probable that one of the motives of these
raids was to keep at home fleets of English airplanes
which might be more useful on the
front. Indeed, many Englishmen, alarmed
by the damage, urged such a policy, but the
good sense of the English leaders prevented
such a mistake from being made. Pitiful as
must have been the suffering in individual
cases, the whole of the damage caused by the
German frightfulness was but a trifle as compared
with the usefulness of the English air-fleets
when directly sent against the German
armies. Nevertheless, every squadron of German
airplanes sent to England was attacked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
by British aviators, and in those attacks the
Germans suffered many losses.</p>

<p>The worst raid of all those made was one on
June 13th, which was directed upon the city
of London. On that occasion ninety-seven
persons were killed and four hundred and
thirty-seven wounded. These airplane operations
differed from the Zeppelin expeditions
in being carried on in the daytime, and this
raid took place while the schools were in session
and large numbers of people were in the
street. Only one of the attacking airplanes
was brought down. The raiding machines
were of a new type, about three times the size
of the ordinary machine, and there were twenty-two
such machines in the squadron. The
battle in the air was a striking spectacle and
in spite of the danger was watched by millions
of the population. The raiders were easily
seen and their flight seemed like a flight of
swallows as they dived and swerved through
the air.</p>

<p>The raids on England were not the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
raids conducted by the Germans during the
war. Paris suffered, but as soon as the warning
sounded, the sky over the city was alive
with defense airplanes. An attack on the
French capital took place on the 27th of July
and began about midnight. The German airmen,
however, never got further than a suburban
section of the city, and their bombardment
caused but little damage. In one of
the suburbs, however, a German flyer dropped
four bombs on a Red Cross Hospital, killing
two doctors, a chemist and a male nurse, and
injuring a number of patients. The raider
was flying low and the distinguishing marks
of the hospital were plainly apparent.</p>

<p>Almost every day during the bitter fighting
of 1918, reports came in that Allied hospitals
had been bombed by German raiders. Attacks
on hospitals were, of course, strictly forbidden
by the Hague Convention, and they
caused bitter indignation. Such attacks were
of a piece with those upon hospital ships which
were made from time to time. From the very
beginning of the war the Germans could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
understand the psychology of the people of
the Allied countries. They were not fighting
slaves, ready to cower under the lash, but with
free people, ready to fight for liberty and
roused to fury by lawlessness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<span class="smcap">Red Revolution in Russia</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Russian Revolution was not a sudden
movement of the people. Long before
the war it had raised its head. The Duma itself
came into existence as one of its fruits;
but when the war began all parties joined in
patriotic support of the Russian armies and
laid aside for the time their cherished grievances.
The war was immensely popular.
Slavonic nationalism turned against Austria-Hungary
and Germany who were bent upon
crushing the Slavonic sister state, Serbia.
The Liberal elements saw in Germany the
stronghold of reaction and of militarism, and
trusted that its downfall would be followed by
that of Russian autocracy. But so glaring
was the incapacity of the old régime, that a
union was formed during the war by all the
Liberal parties. This group united on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
single aim of pushing on the war, and silently
preparing for the moment when the catastrophe
to Czarism was to come.</p>

<p>This was long before the revolution. But
a conviction of the necessity of immediate
change gradually came to all. The Czar himself
brought matters to an issue. His vacillation,
his appointment of ministers who were
not only reactionary, but were suspected of
being German tools, were too much for even
honest supporters of the Imperial régime.
Some of these reactionaries, it is true, were
easily driven from power. In 1915 Sukhomlinov
and Maklakov were overthrown by the
influence of the army and the Duma. But in
1916 the parasites came to life again. M.
Boris Stuermer became Prime Minister, and
appointed as Minister of the Interior the notorious
Protopopov. On November 14,
1916, Miliukov, the leader of the Constitutional
Democrats, or Cadet Party, attacked
the Premier in one of the fiercest speeches ever
made in the Russian Duma. Stuermer was
compelled to resign, but his successor, M.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
Trepov, though an honest man with high ambitions,
was forced to retain Protopopov at
the Interior. For a moment there was calm.
But it was the calm before the storm.</p>

<p>The Russian Revolution, now recognized as
the most bloody revolution in history, began
with the assassination of a single man. This
man was Gregory Novikh, known throughout
the world under the name of Rasputin. A
Siberian peasant by birth, immoral, filthy in
person, untrained in mind, he had early received
the nickname of Rasputin, which means
“ne’er-do-well,” on account of his habits. A
drunkard, and a libertine always, he posed as
a sort of saint and miracle worker, let his hair
grow long, and tramped about the world barefoot.</p>

<p>Rasputin had left his district of Tobolsk
and at Moscow had started a new cult, where
mystical séances were mingled with debauchery.
Through Madame Verubova he had
been introduced to the Empress herself. He
became the friend of Count Witte, of
Stuermer, and Protopopov was his tool.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
Rumor credited him with exercising an extraordinary
influence upon the Czarina, and
through her upon the Czar. This influence
was thought to be responsible for many of
the Czar’s unpopular policies. In times of
great public agitation the wildest rumors are
easily taken for truth and the absurd legends
which were easily associated with his name
were greedily accepted by people of every
rank. The influence of Rasputin over the
Imperial family was denied again and again.
It has been said from authoritative sources that
the Czar did not know him by sight, and that
the Czarina knew him only as a superstitious
and neurotic woman might know some fortune
teller or other charlatan. Nevertheless
the credulous public believed him to be the evil
spirit of the Imperial circle, and every false
move, every unpopular act, was ascribed to his
baneful influence. But such a career could
not last long, and the end became a tragedy.</p>

<p>Several times Rasputin had been attacked,
but had escaped. At last, on the 29th of December,
1916, Prince Yusapov, a young man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
of wealth and position, invited him to dine with
him at his own home. The Prince came for
him in his own car. Entering the dining-room,
they found there the Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovitch.
M. Purishkevitch, a member of the
Duma, had acted as chauffeur, and he followed
him in. The three told him that he was to die
and he was handed a pistol that he might kill
himself; instead of doing so, he shot at the
Grand Duke, but missed, and then was shot
in turn by his captors. The noise attracted
the attention of the police who inquired what
had happened. “I have just killed a dog,”
was the reply.</p>

<p>His body was taken in an automobile to the
Neva River, a hole cut in the ice, and weighted
with stones, it was dropped into the waters.
On the next day his executioners notified the
police of what they had done, and the news
was announced at the Imperial Theatre, whose
audience went wild with enthusiasm, and sang
the National Hymn. No legal action was
ever taken against Rasputin’s executioners.
His body was recovered and given honorable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
burial. The Czarina, according to report, following
the coffin to the grave. And so disappeared
from the Imperial Court one evil
force.</p>

<p>But his tool, Alexander Protopopov, still
survived. Protopopov was an extraordinary
man. In 1916 he had visited England and
France and made a splendid impression. His
speeches, full of fire and patriotism, were regarded
as the best made by any deputation
that had come from Russia. But on his return
to Petrograd he fell completely into the
hands of the Court party. He became associated
with Rasputin, and his wild talk and
restless conduct suggested to many that his
mind had become affected.</p>

<p>After the death of Rasputin, the meeting of
the Duma, which should have taken place on
January 25, 1917, was postponed for a month.
The censorship was drawn tighter, the members
of the secret police were greatly increased,
and a deliberate endeavor, under the direction
of Protopopov was made to encourage an abortive
revolution, so that its overthrow might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
establish the reactionaries in power. But the
attempt failed.</p>

<p>During January and February the people
were calm. No one wanted revolution then.
On February 9th, the labor members of the
War Industry Committee were arrested.
This was regarded as plainly provocative, and
M. Miliukov wrote appeals to the people for
patience. These were suppressed, but no disturbance
ensued. A British Commission, then
on a visit to Russia, reported that there was
no danger of revolution. But the people were
hungry. Speakers in the Duma discussed the
food problem. It became harder and harder
to procure bread, and little that was practical
seemed to be done to improve the situation,
though in some parts of the country there were
large surplus stocks. On March 8th crowds
gathered around the bakery shops, and looted
several of them. The next day the crowds in
the streets increased. Groups of Cossacks
rode here and there, fraternizing with the people.
They, too, were hungry. In the afternoon
two workmen were arrested for disorder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
by the police. A band of Cossacks freed them.
Street speakers began to appear here and
there, and crowds gathered to listen to their
fiery denunciations of the government.</p>

<p>On March 11th, General Khabalov, military
Governor of the city, issued a proclamation
announcing that the police had orders to disperse
all crowds, and that any workman who
did not return to work on Monday morning
would be sent to the trenches. The main
streets of the city were cleared and guarded
by the police and soldiery. The crowds were
enormous, and disorderly, and more than two
hundred of the rioters were killed. Yet it
seemed as if the government had the situation
in a firm grasp, though an ominous incident
was that the Pavlovsk regiment on being ordered
to fire upon the mob, mutinied and had to
be ordered to their quarters.</p>

<p>Meantime Rodzianko, the President of the
Duma, had telegraphed to the Czar:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Situation serious. Anarchy reigns in Capital. Government
is paralyzed. Transport food and fuel supplies
are utterly disorganized. General discontent is growing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
Disorderly firing is going on in streets. Various companies
of soldiers are shooting at each other. It is absolutely
necessary to invest someone, who enjoys the
confidence of the people with powers to form a new
government. No time must be lost, and delay may be
fatal. I pray to God that in this hour responsibility may
not fall on the wearer of the crown.</p>
</div>

<p>The Prime Minister, Prince Golitzin, acting
under power which he had received from
the Czar, prorogued the Duma. But the
Duma refused to be prorogued. Its President,
Rodzianko, holding in his hand the order
for dissolution, announced that the Duma was
now the sole constitutional authority of Russia.</p>

<p>During the night following, the soldiers at
the Capital, and the Socialists, decided upon
their course. The soldiers determined that
they would not fire upon their civilian brothers.
The Socialists planned an alternative scheme
of government.</p>

<p>On March the 12th, the city was taken possession
of by a mob. The Preo Crajenski
Guards refused to fire upon the crowd. The
Volynsky regiment, sent to coerce them, joined
in the mutiny. Followed by the mob, the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
regiments seized the Arsenal. A force of 25,000
soldiers was in the revolt. At 11 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>,
the Courts of Law were set on fire and the
fortress of SS. Peter and Paul was seized.
The police, fighting desperately, were hunted
from their quarters, their papers destroyed
and the prisoners, political and criminal, released
from the jails.</p>

</figure>

<p>During the day the Duma kept in constant
session, awaiting the Emperor, who did not
come. Telegram after telegram was sent him,
each more urgent. There is reason to believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
that these telegrams never reached the Czar.
When information finally did come to him it
was too late. Meantime the Duma appointed
an executive committee. Their names were
Rodzianko, Nekrasov, Konovalov, Dmitrikov,
Lvov, Rjenski, Karaulov, Miliukov, Schledlovski,
Shulgin, Tcheidze and Kerensky.
The workmen and soldiers also formed a committee,
which undertook to influence the troops
now pouring into Petrograd. But the center
of the revolution was still the Duma, and
crowds gathered to listen to its speeches. In
the evening Protopopov surrendered to the
Russian guards, but General Khabalov still
occupied the Admiralty building with such
forces as were faithful.</p>

<p>On March 13th it became evident that the
army in the field was accepting the authority
of the provisional government. The Duma
committee was composed mainly of men of
moderate political views. They moved slowly,
fearing on the one hand the Reactionaries who
still preserved their loyalty to the Czar, and
on the other hand the Council of Labor, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
its extreme views, and its influence with the
troops. The siege of the Admiralty building
was ended by the surrender of General Khabalov.
The police, however, were still keeping
up a desultory resistance, but the mob were
hunting them like wild beasts. On Wednesday,
the 14th of March, the revolution was
over.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee of the Duma and
the Council of the Workmen’s and Soldiers’
Delegates, now universally known as the Soviet,
were working in harmony. Every hour
proclamations were issued, some of them foolish,
some of them, it is thought, inspired by
German agents, and some of them wise and
patriotic. One of the most unfortunate of
these proclamations was one to the army directing
that “the orders of the War Committee
must be obeyed, saving only on those occasions
when they shall contravene the orders and regulations
of the labor deputies and military delegates.”
This same proclamation abolished saluting
for private soldiers off duty. It was the
beginning of the destruction of the Russian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
military power. The proclamation of the
Duma committee itself was admirable:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Citizens</span>:</p>

<p>The Provisional Executive Committee of the Duma,
with the aid and support of the garrison of the capital
and its inhabitants, has now triumphed over the baneful
forces of the old régime in such a manner as to enable
it to proceed to the more stable organization of the
executive power. With this object, the Provisional Committee
will name ministers of the first national cabinet
men whose past public activity assures them the confidence
of the country.</p>

<p>The new cabinet will adopt the following principles
as the basis of its policy:</p>

<p>1. An immediate amnesty for all political and religious
offenses, including military revolts, acts of terrorism, and
agrarian crimes.</p>

<p>2. Freedom of speech, of the press, of associations
and labor organizations, and the freedom to strike; with
an extension of these liberties to officials and troops, in
so far as military and technical conditions permit.</p>

<p>3. The abolition of social, religious, and racial restrictions
and privileges.</p>

<p>4. Immediate preparation for the summoning of a
Constituent Assembly, which, with universal suffrage as
a basis, shall establish the governmental régime and the
constitution of the country.</p>

<p>5. The substitution for the police of a national militia,
with elective heads and subject to the self-governing
bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>6. Communal elections to be carried out on the basis
of universal suffrage.</p>

<p>7. The troops that have taken part in the revolutionary
movement shall not be disarmed, but they are not
to leave Petrograd.</p>

<p>8. While strict military discipline must be maintained
on active service, all restrictions upon soldiers in the
enjoyment of social rights granted to other citizens are
to be abolished.</p>
</div>

<p>Meantime the Emperor, “the Little Father,”
at first thoroughly incredulous of the
gravity of the situation, had at last become
alarmed. He appointed General Ivanov
Commander-in-Chief of the army, and ordered
him to proceed to Petrograd at the head of a
division of loyal troops. General Ivanov set
out, but his train was held up at Tsarskoe-Selo,
and he returned to Pskov. The Czar himself
then started for the city, but he, too, was held
up at the little station of Bologoi, where workmen
had pulled up the track, and he returned
to Pskov.</p>

<p>He sent for Ruzsky and declared that he was
ready to yield to the Duma and grant a responsible
ministry. Ruzsky advised him to get in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
touch with Rodzianko, and as a result of a
telephone communication with Rodzianko and
with several of his trusted generals, it became
clear that there was no other course than abdication.
Guchkov and Shulgin, messengers
from the Duma, arrived on the evening of
March 15th, and found the Emperor alone, except
for his aide-de-camp, Count Fredericks.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You must abdicate,” Guchkov told him, “in
favor of your son, with the Grand Duke Michael
Alexandrovitch as Regent.”</p>

<p>The Emperor sat for a long time silent. “I
cannot be separated from my boy,” he said.
“I will hand the throne to my brother.” Taking
a sheet of paper he wrote as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By the Grace of God, We, Nicholas II, Emperor of
all the Russias, to all our faithful subjects:</p>

<p>In the course of a great struggle against a foreign
enemy, who has been endeavoring for three years to
enslave our country, it has pleased God to send Russia
a further bitter trial. Internal troubles have threatened
to compromise the progress of the war. The destinies of
Russia, the honor of her heroic army, the happiness of
her people, and the whole future of our beloved country
demand that at all costs victory shall be won. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
enemy is making his last efforts, and the moment is near
when our gallant troops, in concert with their glorious
Allies, will finally overthrow him.</p>

<p>In these days of crisis we have considered that our
nation needs the closest union of all its forces for the
attainment of victory. In agreement with the Imperial
Duma, we have recognized that for the good of our land
we should abdicate the throne of the Russian state and
lay down the supreme power.</p>

<p>Not wishing to separate ourselves from our beloved
son, we bequeath our heritage to our brother, the Grand
Duke Michael Alexandrovitch, with our blessing upon
the future of the Russian throne. We bequeath it to
him with the charge to govern in full unison with the
national representatives who may sit in the legislature,
and to take his inviolable oath to them in the name of
our well-beloved country.</p>

<p>We call upon all faithful sons of our land to fulfil this
sacred and patriotic duty in obeying their Emperor at
this painful moment of national trial, and to aid him,
together with the representatives of the nation, to lead
the Russian people in the way of prosperity and glory.</p>

<p>May God help Russia.</p>
</div>

<p>So ended the reign of Nicholas the Second,
Czar of all the Russias. The news of the
Czar’s abdication spread over the world with
great rapidity, and was received by the Allies
with mixed feelings. The Czar had been
scrupulously loyal to the alliance. He was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
man of high personal character, and his sympathies
on the whole, liberal; but he was a weak
man in a position in which even a strong man
might have failed. He was easily influenced,
especially by his wife. Warned again and
again of the danger before him, he constantly
promised improvement, only to fail in keeping
his promises. He deeply loved his wife, and
yielded continually to her unwise advice.</p>

<p>The Empress Alexandra Feodorovna is but
another instance of a devoted queen who dethroned
her consort. She believed in Divine
Right and looked with suspicion upon popular
leaders. Her one object in life was to hand
on the Russian crown to her son, with no atom
of its power diminished. She surrounded herself
and her husband with scoundrels and charlatans.</p>

<p class="caption">THE WOMEN’S “BATTALION OF DEATH” IN NATIONAL DANCE</p>

<p>A unique outgrowth of the Russian revolution was this organization of women, which came into prominence at the beginning of the
break-up of the Russian front.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the whole, the feeling among the Allies
was one of relief. There was a general distrust
of the influences which had been surrounding
the Czar. The patriotism of the
Grand Duke Michael was well known, and a
government conducted by him was sure to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>a great improvement. But it was not to be.
Before the news of the abdication reached Petrograd
a new ministry had been formed by the
Duma. Miliukov announced their names and
explained their credentials. The Prime Minister
was Prince George Lvov. Miliukov was
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Guchkov Minister
of War and Marine, Kerensky, a new name
in the government, Minister of Justice. The
ministry included representatives of every
party of the left and centre.</p>

<p>Miliukov declared that their credentials
came from the Russian revolution: “We shall
not fight for the sake of power. To be in
power is not a reward or pleasure but a sacrifice.
As soon as we are told that the sacrifice
is no longer needed, we shall give up our places
with gratitude for the opportunity which has
been accorded us.”</p>

<p>He concluded by informing his hearers that
the despot who had brought Russia to the
brink of ruin would either abdicate of his free
will, or be deposed. He added that the Grand
Duke Michael would be appointed Regent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>This announcement at once produced an explosion.
A ministry of moderates and a continuance
of the Imperial government under a
regency stirred the delegates of the workmen
and soldiers to revolt. For a time it seemed
as if the new government would disappear in
the horrors of mob rule. But Kerensky saved
the situation. Making his way into the meeting
of the Soviet he burst into an impassioned
speech.</p>

<p>“Comrades!” he cried, “I have been appointed
Minister of Justice. No one is a more
ardent Republican than I, but we must bide
our time. Nothing can come to its full growth
at once. We shall have our Republic but we
must first win the war. The need of the moment
is organization and discipline and that
need will not wait.”</p>

<p>His eloquence carried the day. The Soviet
passed a resolution supporting the provisional
government with only fifteen dissenting votes.
But it had been made clear that the people did
not approve of the regency, and on the night of
the 15th of March, Prince Lvov, Kerensky and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
other leaders of the Duma sought out the
Grand Duke Michael and informed him of the
situation. The Grand Duke yielded to the
people, and on Friday, March the 16th, issued
a declaration which ended the power of the
Romanovs in Russia:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am firmly resolved to accept the supreme power only
if this should be the desire of our great people, who
must, by means of a plebiscite through their representatives
in the Constituent Assembly, establish the form of
government and the new fundamental laws of the Russian
state. Invoking God’s blessing, I, therefore, request all
citizens of Russia to obey the provisional government,
set up on the initiative of the Duma, and invested with
plenary powers, until within as short a time as possible
the Constituent Assembly elected on a basis of equal,
universal and secret suffrage, shall enforce the will of
the nation regarding the future form of the constitution.</p>
</div>

<p>With this declaration the sacred monarchy
had disappeared. In one week the people had
come to their own and Russia was free. But
what the form of new government was to replace
the old régime was still the question.
There were two rival theories as to the principles
to be followed, one that of the Moderates,
the other of the Extremists. The Moderates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
who controlled the provisional government,
were practical men. They realized that Russia
was at war and that efficient administration
was the great need.</p>

<p>The Extremists of the Soviet were a different
type of men. They were profoundly ignorant
of all practical questions of government;
their creed was socialism. The Socialistic
party in Russia may be divided into three
different groups. The first, the Social Revolutionary
party, came into prominence in Russia
about 1900. It was composed of followers
of the Russian Lavrov who believed in the socialist
state, but a state which should not be a
tyrant overriding the individual. Liberty was
his watchword and he made his appeal not only
to the workmen in the shops but with a special
force to the peasant. He did not preach class
war in the ordinary sense, and believed in the
value of national life. To this party belonged
Kerensky, more and more becoming the leader
of the revolutionary movement.</p>

<p>The second group of the Socialist party were
the Bolsheviki. This group were followers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
the German Karl Marx. The revolution
which they sought was essentially a class revolution.
To the Bolsheviki the fate of their
country mattered not at all. They were eager
for peace on any terms. The only war in
which they were interested was a class war;
they recognized no political boundaries. The
leader of this group was Vladimir Iljetch Uljanov,
who, under his pen name of Lenine, was
already widely known and who had now obtained
the opportunity which he had long desired.</p>

<p>The third group were the Mensheviki. The
Mensheviki believed in the importance of the
working classes, but they did not ignore other
classes. They were willing to use existing
forms of government to carry out the reforms
they desired. They saw that the Allied cause
was their own cause, the cause of the workman
as well as the intellectual.</p>

<p>The Soviet contained representatives of these
three groups. It did not represent Russia,
but it was in Petrograd and could exert its influence
directly upon the government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>The attitude of the provisional government
toward the Imperial family was at first not unkindly.
The Czar and the Czarina were escorted
to the Alexandrovsky Palace in Tsarskoe-Selo.
The Czar for a time lived quietly
as plain Nicholas Romanov. The Czarina and
her children were very ill with measles, the case
of the little Prince being complicated by the
breaking out of an old wound in his foot. The
Grand Duchess Tatiana was in a serious condition
and oxygen had been administered. As
his family improved in health the Czar amused
himself by strolls in the palace yard, and even
by shoveling snow. Later on Nicholas was
transferred to Tobolsk, Siberia, and then, in
May, 1918, to Yekaterinberg. His wife and
his daughter Marie accompanied him to the latter
place, while Alexis and his other three
daughters remained in Tobolsk. On July
20th a Russian government dispatch announced
his assassination. It read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At the first session of the Central Executive Committee,
elected by the Fifth Congress of the Councils, a
message was made public that had been received by direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
wire from the Ural Regional Council, concerning the
shooting of the ex-Czar, Nicholas Romanov. Recently
Yekaterinberg, the Capital of the Red Urals, was seriously
threatened by the approach of Czecho-Slovak bands,
and a counter-revolutionary conspiracy was discovered,
which had as its object the wresting of the ex-Czar from
the hands of the Council’s authority. In view of this
fact the President of the Ural Regional Council decided
to shoot the ex-Czar, and the decision was carried out
on July 16th.</p>
</div>

<p>The wife and the son of Nicholas Romanov
had been sent to a place of security. In a detailed
account of the execution, published in
Berlin, it appeared that the Czar had been
awakened at five o’clock in the morning, and
informed that he was to be executed in two
hours. He spent some time with a priest in
his bedroom and wrote several letters. According
to this account, when the patrol came
to take him out for execution he was found in
a state of collapse. His last words, uttered
just before the executioners fired, are reported
to have been “Spare my wife and my innocent
and unhappy children. May my blood
preserve Russia from ruin.”</p>

<p>The Russian press, including the Socialist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
papers, condemned the execution as a cruel and
unnecessary act. The charges of conspiracy
were utterly unproven, and were merely an
excuse. The Central Executive Committee,
however, accepted the decision of the Ural
Regional Soviet as being regular, and a decree
by the Bolshevist Government declared all the
property of the former Emperor, his wife, his
mother and all the members of the Imperial
house, forfeit to the Soviet Republic.</p>

<p>Meantime the provisional government,
which had taken power on the 16th of March,
seemed as if it might succeed. Miliukov,
whose announcement of the Regency had made
him unpopular, declared for a Republic. The
great army commanders for the most part accepted
the revolution. The Grand Duke Nicholas
was removed from his command and the
other Grand Dukes were ordered not to leave
Petrograd. Alexeiev became commander-in-chief;
Ruzsky had the northern group of armies,
Brusilov the southern; Kornilov was in
command of Petrograd, and the central group
was put under the command of Lechitsky.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
Reports came that discipline was improving
everywhere on the front.</p>

<p>The plans of the government, too, met with
general approval. Their policy was announced
by Prince Lvov. “The new government
considers it its duty to make known to
the world that the object of free Russia is not
to dominate other nations and forcibly to take
away their territory. The object of independent
Russia is a permanent peace and the
right of all nations to determine their own destiny.”</p>

<p>Kerensky, in inspiring speeches, encouraged
the country to war, and declared against a
separate peace. The new government announced
that Poland was to receive complete
independence, with a right to determine its
own form of government, and its relation, if
any, to Russia. In Finland the Governor,
Sein, was removed. A Liberal was appointed
Governor and the Finnish Diet was convened.
A manifesto was issued on March 21st, completely
restoring the Finnish constitution. To
the Armenians Kerensky expressed himself as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
in favor of an autonomous government for
them, under Russia’s protection, and on March
25th, absolute equality of the Jews was proclaimed
by the new government. A number
of Jews were made officers in the army, and
two Jewish advocates were appointed members
of the Russian Senate and of the Supreme
Court. On April 4th full religious liberty
was proclaimed, and on the same date the Prime
Minister promised a delegation of women that
women would be given the right to vote.</p>

<p>These acts caused a general subsidence of
unrest, and public good feeling was increased
by the return of the political exiles and prisoners
from Siberia. A full hundred thousand
of such prisoners were released, and their progress
across Siberia to Russia was one grand
triumphal march.</p>

<p>The most celebrated of these political prisoners
were two women, Catherine Breshkovskaya
and Marie Spiridonova. Catherine
Breshkovskaya was known as the grandmother
of the revolution. Forty-four years of her
life were spent in exile. When she reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Petrograd she was met at the railroad depot by
a military band, and carried in procession
through the streets. Equally popular was
Marie Spiridonova, who, though still young,
had suffered martyrdom. She had been tortured
with cruelty that is unprintable. Her
face had been disfigured for life. The agents
who had inflicted the torture were assassinated
by the revolutionists.</p>

<p>It was a great day for Russia, and the outlook
seemed full of promise.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<span class="smcap">The Descent to Bolshevism</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE hopes entertained for the new Republic
of Russia were doomed to disappointment.
For a short time, under the leadership
of Lvov, the Russians marched along the path
of true democracy. But the pace became too
rapid.</p>

<p>The government prospered in Petrograd,
and the economic organization of the country
proceeded with great speed. An eight-hour
day was introduced in the capital and in many
other cities throughout the republic. The
fever of organization spread even to the peasants.
They formed a Council of Peasants’
Deputies, modeled after the Council of Workmen
and Soldiers. On the 13th of April, 1917,
came the first meeting of the All-Russia Congress
of Soviets, and with it a revival of the differences
of opinion which ultimately were to
destroy the government. The great majority
were for war, but the minority, led by Lenine
and the Bolsheviki element, demanded an immediate
peace. They declared that the enemies
of the Revolution were not the Central
Powers, but the capitalists in all countries, and
not least the Provisional Government of Russia.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>Some clew to the meaning of the Bolsheviki
movement in Russia is to be found in the life
of Lenine, its leading spirit. It has been
charged that he was the tool of the German
Government. He undoubtedly received facilities
from the German Government to return
to Russia from Switzerland immediately after
the Revolution in March. His whole career,
however, suggests that he was not a tool, but
a fanatic.</p>

<p>He was born in Simbirsk, in Central Russia,
in the year 1870. Lenine was only one of the
several aliases that he had found it necessary
to adopt at various times. He was of good
family, and received his education at the Petrograd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
University. From the very beginning he
took an active interest in the political and social
problems of the day. In 1887 his brother,
A. Uljanov, was arrested, and after a secret
trial condemned to death and hanged as a participant
in a plot to wreck the imperial train
carrying Alexander III. Lenine was also arrested,
but was released on account of a lack of
evidence. At this time the Russian Socialistic
movement was still in its infancy.</p>

<p>Lenine spent his Sundays in a circle of uneducated
workmen, explaining to them the elements
of socialistic economics. Along with
this propaganda work he studied deeply the
economic phases of Russian life, being especially
interested in its working and peasant
classes. He wrote several books on the subject,
which are still accepted as valuable representatives
of Russian economic literature.
Because of his socialistic activities, Lenine was
compelled to leave Russia on several occasions,
when he lived in Switzerland, France and Austria.
From these countries he directed the
work of one of the groups of the Social Democratic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
party, and became an important leader.</p>

<p>In the General Russian Socialistic Convention,
held in 1903, this group made a definite
stand for its program and policies. This was
the time when the word “Bolsheviki” was
coined, meaning the “majority,” who had voted
in accord with Lenine’s proposals. Lenine believed
in the seizure of political power by means
of violent revolution and in establishing a proletarian
government. After the Revolution
of 1905, the Lenine faction dwindled and it
seemed as if Bolshevism was destined to die
out. But in 1911, with the awakening of a
new spirit in the political and social life of Russia,
a new impetus was given to the activities
of the Bolsheviki. The first Socialist daily
paper, <i>Pravda</i>, (“the Truth,”) was one of their
efforts. In 1913 the Bolsheviki sent six representatives
to the Duma.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the war Lenine was in
Cracow. Like other revolutionary leaders he
was compelled to live in exile. He went to
Switzerland where he remained until the news
of the successful revolution caused his return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
to Russia. On his arrival in Petrograd he
gathered together his followers and began the
agitation in favor of the Bolshevist program
and of peace.</p>

<p>The first sign of the conflict between the Provisional
Government and the Soviet arose in
connection with the joint note sent to the Allies
by the Provisional Government on May 1st.
This note was signed by Foreign Secretary
Miliukov. It declared, among other things,
that the Provisional Government would “maintain
a strict regard for its engagements with
the Allies of Russia.”</p>

<p>The document aroused strong disapproval
among many members of the Council of the
Soviet, and serious anti-government demonstrations
occurred in Petrograd on May 3rd
and 4th. These demonstrations were directed
distinctly against Miliukov. Detachments of
soldiers and workmen gathered in front of the
headquarters of the Provisional Government,
carrying banners, with inscriptions “Down
with Miliukov! Down with the Provisional
Government!” Miliukov appealed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
crowd for confidence, and his words were
greeted with hearty cheering.</p>

<p>The Soviet Council ultimately voted confidence
in the Government by a narrow margin
of 35 in a total of 2500. But the agitation
against the Government persisted, and on May
16th Miliukov resigned. General Kornilov,
Commander of the Petrograd Garrison, and
Guchkov, Minister of War, finding their control
of the army weakened by the interference
of the Soviet Council, also resigned.</p>

<p>The situation became critical. As a result
of this agitation a new coalition government
was formed. Prince Lvov remained Prime
Minister. Terestchenko became Foreign Minister.
Most significant of all, Kerensky became
the Minister of War. The new Government
issued a new declaration of policy, promising
a firm support of the war with Germany,
and an effort to call together at the earliest
possible date a Constituent Assembly to deal
with questions of land and of finance. This
manifesto was received coldly by the Soviets
and their press.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>It was at this time that Allies sent special
missions to Russia to aid the Russian Government
in forwarding the fight against the common
enemy. The American mission to Russia
was headed by Elihu Root, former Secretary of
State.</p>

<p>It was most cordially received, and housed
in the former Winter Palace of the Czar. On
June 15th the American Ambassador, David
R. Francis, presented the Root mission to the
Council of Ministers in the Marinsky Palace,
and Mr. Root made an eloquent address, declaring
the sympathy of the American Republic
with the new Russian Democracy. He declared
that the liberty of both nations was in
danger. “The armed forces of military autocracy
are at the gates of Russia and the Allies.
The triumph of German arms will mean
the death of liberty in Russia. No enemy is
at the gates of America, but America has come
to realize that the triumph of German arms
means the death of Liberty in the world.”</p>

<p>At Moscow Mr. Root addressed representatives
of the Zemstvo and the local Council of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
the Workmen and Soldiers. He was warmly
applauded, and on motion of the Mayor a telegram
was sent to President Wilson, thanking
him for sending the Root Commission to Russia.
The Root Mission returned to the United
States early in August, and reported to Washington
August 12th. At a public reception
given by the citizens of New York, Senator
Root expressed supreme confidence in the stability
of the Revolution.</p>

<p>On July 1st, inspired by Kerensky, and under
the personal leadership of General Kornilov,
the Russian army began an offensive in
Galicia. It first met with complete success,
capturing Halicz, and sweeping forward close
to Dolina in the Carpathian foothills. Then
under a very slight hostile German pressure,
the Russian armies, immediately to the north
and south of Kornilov’s army, broke and ran.
This action was directly traced to orders subversive
of discipline, emanating from the Petrograd Soviet.
Kornilov’s army was compelled
to retire, and by July 21st was in full
retreat from Galicia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>The Russian mutiny spread. Regiments refused
to fight or to obey their officers.</p>

<p>One of the most picturesque episodes of this
phase of the war was the formation of a woman’s
regiment, known as the “Command of
Death,” which was reviewed at Petrograd
June 21st, by Minister of War, Kerensky.
In front of the barracks assigned to this regiment
a visitor found posted at the gate a little
blue-eyed sentry in a soldier’s khaki blouse,
short breeches, green forage cap, ordinary
woman’s black stockings and neat shoes. The
sentry was Mareya Skridlov, daughter of Admiral
Skridlov, former commander of the Baltic
fleet and Minister of Marines. In the
courtyard three hundred girls were drilling,
mostly between 18 and 25 years old, of good
physique and many of them pretty. They
wore their hair short or had their heads entirely
shaved. They were drilling under the instruction
of a male sergeant of the Volynsky regiment,
and marched to an exaggerated goose
step.</p>

<p>The girl commander, Lieutenant Buitchkarev,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
explained that most of the recruits were
from the higher educational academies, with a
few peasants, factory girls and servants.
Some married women were accepted, but none
who had children. The Battalion of Death
distinguished itself on the field, setting an example
of courage to the mutinous regiments
during the retreat of Brusilov.</p>

<p>With the army thus demoralized the Russian
Revolution encountered a perilous period
toward the end of July, 1917, and civil war
or anarchy seemed almost at hand, when out
of the depths of the national spirit there arose
a new revolution to save the situation and to
maintain order. The country was everywhere
the scene of riotous disturbances. Anarchists,
radicals, and monarchists seemed to be working
hand-in-hand to precipitate a reign of terror,
when once more Kerensky saved the situation.
On July 20th, it was announced that
the Premier, Prince Lvov, had resigned, and
that Alexander Kerensky had been appointed
Premier, but would also retain his portfolio as
Minister of War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>A new government was quickly formed.
Kerensky was made practical Dictator, and
his government received the complete endorsement
of a joint Congress of the Soviets and
the Council of peasant delegates. Kerensky
acted with the utmost vigor. Orders were
given to fire on deserters and warrants issued
for the arrest of revolutionary agitators whoever
they might be. Rear-Admiral Verdervski,
commander of the Baltic fleet, was seized
for communicating a secret government telegram
to sailors’ committees. Agitators from
the Soviet were arrested, charged with inciting
the Peterhof troops against the Federal
government. On July 22d, the following resolution
was passed by the joint Congress:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Recognizing that the country is menaced by a military
debacle on the front and by anarchy at home, it is
resolved:</p>

<p>1. That the country and the revolution are in danger.</p>

<p>2. That the Provisional Government is proclaimed the
Government of National Safety.</p>

<p>3. That unlimited powers are accorded the Government
for re-establishing the organization and discipline
of the army for a fight to a finish against the enemies
of public order, and for the realization of the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
program embodied in the governmental program just
announced.</p>
</div>

<p>The re-organization of the Councils of the
All-Russia, and Workmen’s and Peasants’ Organizations
on the 23rd, issued a ringing address
to the army denouncing its mutinous
spirit and warning it of the inevitable result.
The Provisional Government also issued a
proclamation on July 22nd, charging that the
disorders were precipitated to bring about a
counter-revolution by the enemies of the country.
But the army was demoralized. It disregarded
discipline and refused to recognize
military rule. A general retreat followed.
The Germans and Austrians steadily advanced
through Galicia and crossed the frontier before
the Russian armies could be forced to make a
stand.</p>

<p>The death penalty for treason or mutiny
was restored in the army on July 25th, when
Kerensky threatened to resign unless this was
done. On that same date the government authorized
the Minister of the Interior to suspend
the publication of periodicals that incite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
to insubordination or disobedience to orders
given by the military authorities. By July
28th the situation had become more hopeful.
On that day General Ruzsky, formerly commander-in-chief
of the northern armies of Russia,
and General Gurko, ex-commander on the
Russian southwestern front, were summoned
to Petrograd. Each had retired on account
of the interference of the Council of Workmen
and Soldiers’ delegates. Their return to
the service was a hopeful sign. The Soviet
also passed by an overwhelming majority a
resolution censuring Lenine, and demanding
that he should be publicly tried. Charges had
been made that Lenine and his associates were
working under German direction and financed
by Germans. On August 2nd, Kornilov became
Commander-in-Chief of the Russian
army. A disagreement in the Cabinet led to
its re-organization. In the new Cabinet appeared
again representatives of the Constitutional
Democratic party. Conditions began
to show improvement from this time forth.</p>

<p>An extraordinary National Council met at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
Moscow August 26th, 1917. This conference
consisted of 2,500 delegates representing the
Duma, the Soviets, the Zemstvos, and indeed
all organized Russia. Kerensky opened the
conference in a speech of great length in which
he reviewed the general situation, declaring
that the destructive period of the Revolution
had passed and that the time had come to consolidate
its conquests.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important address before
the Council was that made by General Kornilov,
Commander-in-Chief of the army. General
Kornilov was received with prolonged
cheers, which in the light of his subsequent
action were especially significant. General
Kornilov described with much detail the disorganization
and insubordination in the army,
and continued:</p>

<p>“We are implacably fighting anarchy in the
army. Undoubtedly it will finally be repressed,
but the danger of fresh debacles is
weighing constantly on the country. The situation
on the front is bad. We have lost the
whole of Galicia, the whole of Bukowina, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
all the fruits of our recent victories. If Russia
wishes to be saved the army must be regenerated
at any cost.” General Kornilov
then outlined the most important of the reform
measures which he recommended, and concluded:
“I believe that the genius and the
reason of the Russian people will save the
country. I believe in a brilliant future for
our army. I believe its ancient glory will be
restored.”</p>

<p>General Kaledines, leader of the Don Cossacks,
mounted the tribune and read a resolution
passed by the Cossacks demanding the
continuation of the war until complete victory
was attained. He defied the extreme Radicals.
“Who saved you from the Bolsheviki
on the 14th of July?” he asked contemptuously.
“We Cossacks have been free men. We are
not made drunk by our new-found liberties
and are unblinded by party or program. We
tell you plainly and categorically, ‘Remove
yourselves from the place which you have
neither the ability nor the courage to fill, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
let better men than yourselves step in, or take
the consequences of your folly.’”</p>

<p>The conference took no definite action, being
invested with no authority, but it served
to bring out clearly the line of cleavage between
the Radical or Socialistic element represented
by Kerensky and the Conservatives
represented by the Generals of the army.</p>

<p>Immediately on the heels of the Moscow
conference an important German advance was
made in the direction of Riga, the most important
Russian Baltic port. In spite of a
vigorous defense the Germans captured the
city.</p>

<p>The loss of Riga intensified the political excitement
in Russia, and produced a profound
crisis. A wave of unrest spread throughout
the country. The Grand Duke Michael, and
the Grand Duke Paul with their families, were
arrested on a charge of conspiracy. The Provisional
Government was charged with responsibility
of the collapse of the army.</p>

<p>It was on September 9th, that the storm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
broke, and General Kornilov, the Commander-in-Chief
of the Russian armies, raised the flag
of revolt against the Provisional Government.
The details of the revolt are as follows:</p>

<p>At one o’clock Saturday afternoon, Deputy
Lvov, of the Duma, called upon Premier
Kerensky, and declared that he had come as the
representative of General Kornilov to demand
the surrender of all power into Kornilov’s
hands. M. Lvov said that this demand did not
emanate from Kornilov only but was supported
by an organization of Duma members, Moscow
industrial interests, and other conservatives.
This group, said M. Lvov, did not object
to Kerensky personally, but demanded
that he transfer the Portfolio of War to M.
Savinkov, assistant Minister of War, who all
along had supported Kornilov.</p>

<p>“If you agree,” M. Lvov added, “we invite
you to come to headquarters and meet General
Kornilov, giving you a solemn guarantee
that you will not be arrested.”</p>

<p>Premier Kerensky replied that he could not
believe Kornilov to be guilty of such an act of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
treason, and that he would communicate with
him directly. In an exchange of telegrams
Kornilov confirmed fully to the Premier his
demands. Kerensky promptly placed Lvov
under arrest, denounced Kornilov as a traitor
and deposed him from his position as Commander-in-Chief,
General Klembovsky being
appointed in his place. General Kornilov responded
to the order of dismissal by moving
an army against the Capital.</p>

<p>Martial law was declared in Moscow and in
Petrograd. Kerensky assumed the functions
of Commander-in-Chief and took military
measures to defend Petrograd and resist the
rebels. On the 12th it was clear that the Kornilov
revolt had failed to receive the expected
support. Kornilov advanced toward Petrograd,
and occupied Jotchina, thirty miles
southwest of the Capital, but there was no
bloodshed. On the night of the 13th, General
Alexeiev demanded Kornilov’s unconditional
surrender, and the revolt collapsed. Kornilov
was arrested and the Provisional Government
reconstituted on stronger lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>After the so-called Kornilov revolt, the Russian
Revolution assumed a form which might
almost be called stable. A democratic congress
met at Moscow, September 27th, and
adopted a resolution providing for a preliminary
parliament to consist of 231 members, of
whom 110 were to represent the Zemstvos and
the towns. The congress refused its sanction
to a coalition cabinet in which the Constitutional
Democrats should participate, but Kerensky
practically defied the congress, and
named a coalition cabinet, in which several
portfolios were held by members of the Constitutional
Democratic Party. The new government
issued a statement declaring that it
had three principal aims: to raise the fighting
power of the army and navy; to bring order
to the country by fighting anarchy; to call the
Constituent Assembly as soon as possible.
The Constituent Assembly was called to assemble
in December. It was to consist of 732
delegates to be elected by popular vote.</p>

<p>Meantime agitation against the Coalition
Government continued. On November 1st,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
the Premier issued a statement through the Associated
Press, to all the newspapers of the
Entente, which conveyed the information that
he almost despaired of restoring civil law in
the distracted country. He said that he felt
that help was needed urgently and that Russia
asked it as her right. “Russia has fought
consistently since the beginning,” he said.
“She saved France and England from disaster
early in the war. She is worn out by the
strain and claims as her right that the Allies
now shoulder the burden.”</p>

<p>On November 7th, an armed insurrection
against the Coalition Government and Premier
Kerensky was precipitated by the Bolsheviki
faction. The revolt was headed by Leon
Trotzky, President of the Central Executive
Committee of the Petrograd Council, with
Nicholas Lenine, the Bolsheviki leader. The
Revolutionists seized the offices of the telephone
and telegraph companies and occupied
the state bank and the Marie Palace where
the preliminary Parliament had been sitting.
The garrison at Petrograd espoused the cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
of the Bolsheviki and complete control was
seized with comparatively little fighting. The
Government troops were quickly overpowered,
except at the Winter Palace, whose chief
guardians were the Woman’s Battalion, and
the Military Cadets. The Woman’s Battalion
fought bravely, and suffered terribly, and with
the Military Cadets who also remained true,
held the Palace for several hours. The Bolsheviki
brought up armored cars and the cruiser
Aurora, and turned the guns of the Fortress
of SS. Peter and Paul upon the Palace before
its defenders would surrender.</p>

<p>That evening the Revolutionary Committee
issued a characteristic proclamation, denouncing
the government of Kerensky as opposed
to the government and the people, and calling
upon the soldiers in the army to arrest their
officers if they did not at once join the Revolution.
They announced the following program:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>First: The offer of an immediate democratic peace.</p>

<p>Second: The immediate handing over of large proportional
lands to the peasants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Third: The transmission of all authority to the Council
of Workmen’s and Soldiers’ Delegates.</p>

<p>Fourth: The honest convocation of the Constitutional
Assembly.</p>
</div>

<p>At a meeting of the Council Trotzky declared
that the Government no longer existed,
and introduced Lenine as an old comrade
whom he welcomed back. Lenine was received
with prolonged cheers, and said: “Now
we have a Revolution. The peasants and
workmen control the Government. This is
only a preliminary step toward a similar revolution
everywhere.”</p>

<p>Proclamation after proclamation came from
the new Government. In one of them it was
stated “M. Kerensky has taken flight, and all
military bodies have been empowered to take
all possible measures to arrest Kerensky and
bring him back to Petrograd. All complicity
with Kerensky will be dealt with as high treason.”</p>

<p>A Bolsheviki Cabinet was named. The
Premier was Nicholas Lenine; the Foreign
Minister, Leon Trotzky. The other Cabinet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
members were all Bolsheviki, including Bibenko,
a Kronstadt sailor, of the Committee
on War and Marine, and Shliapnikov, a laborer,
who was Minister of Labor. Lenine’s
personality has already been described.
Trotzky, the chief aid of Lenine’s rebellion,
had been living in New York City three
months before the Czar was overthrown, but
he had previously been expelled from Germany,
France, Switzerland and Spain. His
real name was Leber Braunstein, and he was
born in the Russian Government of Kherson,
near the Black Sea.</p>

<p>When the insurrection occurred, Kerensky
succeeded in escaping from Petrograd, and
persuaded about two thousand Cossacks, several
hundred Military Cadets, and a contingent
of Artillery, to fight under his banner.
He advanced toward Petrograd, but his forces
were greatly outnumbered by the Bolsheviki.
At Tsarskoe-Selo a battle took place, the Kerensky
troops met defeat, and its leader saved
himself by flight.</p>

<p>At Moscow the entire city passed into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
control of the Bolsheviki but not without severe
fighting in which more than three thousand
people were slain. On the collapse of
the Kerensky government conditions throughout
Russia became chaotic. Ukraine declared
its independence, and Finland also severed its
connection with Russia. General Kaledines
declared against the Bolsheviki, and organized
an army to save the country. Siberia, Bessarabia,
Lithuania, the Caucasus and other districts
declared their complete independence of
the Central Government.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviki, in control at Petrograd,
opened negotiations with the Central Powers
for an armistice along the entire front from
the Baltic to Asia Minor, and on December
17th, such an armistice went into effect.
Meanwhile they began negotiations for a treaty
of peace. General Dukholin, the Commander-in-Chief
on November 20th, was ordered
by Lenine to propose the armistice. To this
request he made no reply, and on November
21st, he was deposed and Ensign Krylenko
was appointed the new Commander-in-Chief.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
General Dukholin was subsequently murdered,
by being thrown from a train after the Bolsheviki
seized the general headquarters.</p>

<p>Trotzky sent a note to the representatives
of neutral powers in Petrograd, informing
them of his proposal for an armistice, and
stating, “The consummation of an immediate
peace is demanded in all countries, both belligerent
and neutral. The Russian Government
counts on the firm support of workmen in all
countries in this struggle for peace.” Lenine,
however, declared that Russia did not contemplate
a separate peace with Germany, and that
the Russian Government, before agreeing to
an armistice, would communicate with the Allies
and make a certain proposal to the imperialistic
governments of France and England,
rejection of which would place them in open
opposition to the wishes of their own people.</p>

<p>A period of turmoil followed. In the meantime
elections for the Constituent Assembly
were held. The result in Petrograd was announced
as 272,000 votes for the Bolsheviki,
211,000 for the Constitutional Democrats, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
116,000 for the Social Revolutionaries, showing
that the Bolsheviki failed to attain a majority.
Notwithstanding the prevailing chaos,
the Lenine-Trotzky Government persisted in
negotiations for an armistice, and it was arranged
that the first conference be held at the
German headquarters at Brest-Litovsk.</p>

<p>The Russian delegates were Kaminev, whose
real name was Rosenfelt, a well known Bolshevist
leader; Sokolnikov, a sailor; Bithenko,
a soldier, and Mstislasky, who had formerly
been librarian to the General Staff, but who
was now a strong Socialist. Representatives
were present of Germany, Austria-Hungary,
Turkey and Bulgaria.</p>

<p>After many interchanges of opinion a suspension
of hostilities for ten days was authorized,
to be utilized in bringing to a conclusion
negotiations for an armistice. On December
7th it was announced from Petrograd
that for the first time since the war not a shot
was fired on the Russian front. Foreign Secretary
Trotzky, on the 6th of December, notified
the allied embassies in Petrograd of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
negotiations and added that the armistice
would be signed only on condition that the
troops should not be transferred from one
front to another. He announced that negotiations
had been suspended to accord the Allied
Governments opportunity to define their attitude
toward the peace negotiation; that is,
their willingness or refusal to participate in
negotiations for an armistice and peace. In
case of refusal they must declare clearly and
definitely before all mankind the aims for
which the peoples of Europe had been called to
shed their blood during the fourth year of the
war.</p>

<p>No official replies were made to this note.
On December 7th, Generals Kaledines and
Kornilov raised the standard of revolt, but
reports indicated that the Bolsheviki were extending
their control over all Russia. A meeting
of the Constituent Assembly took place
on December 11th. Less than 50 of the 600
delegates attended. Meanwhile the negotiations
for an armistice continued. On December
16th an agreement was reached and an
armistice signed, to continue from December
17th to January 14th, 1918.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Within the first month in which the Bolsheviki
conducted the government numerous
edicts of a revolutionary character were issued.
Class titles, distinctions and privileges were
abolished; the corporate property of nobles,
merchants and burgesses was to be handed over
to the state, as was all church property, lands,
money and precious stones; and religious instruction
was to cease in the schools. Strikes
were in progress everywhere, and disorder was
rampant.</p>

<p>Kornilov, Terestchenko and other associates
of Kerensky, were imprisoned in the Fortress
of SS. Peter and Paul; the Cadet Party was
outlawed by decree and the houses of its leaders
raided. On January 8, 1918, it was announced
that the Bolsheviki had determined
that all loans and Treasury bonds held by foreign
subjects, abroad or in Russia, were repudiated.</p>

<p>During this period the Bolsheviki’s Foreign
Secretary astonished the world by making public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the secret treaties between Russia and Foreign
Governments in the early years of the
war. These treaties dealt with the proposed
annexation by Russia of the Dardanelles, Constantinople
and certain areas in Asia Minor;
with the French claim on Alsace-Lorraine and
the left bank of the Rhine; with offers to
Greece, for the purpose of inducing her to
assist Serbia; with plans to alter her Western
boundaries, with the British and Russian control
of Persia; and with Italy’s desire to annex
certain Austrian territories. These treaties
had been seized upon the Bolsheviki assumption
of power, and were now repudiated by the
new Government.</p>

<p>During the period of the armistice Lenine
began his move for a separate peace, in spite
of the formal protests of the Allied representatives
at Petrograd.</p>

<p>The first sitting took place on Saturday,
December 22, 1917. Among the delegates
were Dr. Richard von Kühlmann, Foreign
Minister, and General Hoffman, of Germany;
Count Czernin, Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Minister Kopov, of Bulgaria; Nesimy
Bey, former Foreign Minister of Turkey,
and a large delegation from Russia, composed
of Bolshevist leaders. Dr. von Kühlmann
was chosen as the presiding officer and made the
opening speech. The Russian peace demands
and the German counter-proposals were then
read, and considered.</p>

<p>The German proposals proved unacceptable
to Russia, and a second session of the peace
conference was held at Brest-Litovsk on January
10, 1918. Trotzky himself attended this
meeting as one of the representatives from
Russia, and there was also a representative
from Ukraine, which had declared its independence,
and was allowed to join the conference.
General Hoffman protested strongly
against the Russian endeavor to make appeals
of a revolutionary character to the German
troops.</p>

<p>The armistice having expired, it was agreed
it should be continued to February 12th.
After a long and acrimonious debate the Conference
broke up in a clash over the evacuation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
of the Russian provinces. On January 24th
it was announced that the Russian delegates
to the peace conference had unanimously decided
to reject the German terms. They
stated that when they asked Germany’s final
terms General Hoffman of the German delegation
had replied by opening a map and pointing
out a line from the shores of the Gulf of
Finland to the east of the Moon Sound Islands,
to Valk, to the west of Minsk, to Brest-Litovsk,
thus eliminating Courland and all the Baltic
provinces.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>Asked the terms of the Central Powers in
regard to the territory south of Brest-Litovsk
General Hoffman replied that was a question
which they would discuss only with Ukraine.
M. Kaminev asked: “Supposing we do not
agree to such condition, what are you going
to do?”</p>

<p>General Hoffman’s answer was, “Within a
week we would occupy Reval.”</p>

<p>On January 27th, Trotzky made his report
to the Soviets at Petrograd. After a thorough
explanation of the peace debates, he declared
that the Government of the Soviets
could not sign such a peace. It was then decided
to demobilize the Russian army and withdraw
from the war.</p>

<p>Final sessions of the peace congress were resumed
at Brest-Litovsk, January 29th; a peace
treaty was made between the Central Powers
and the Ukraine, and the Bolsheviki yielded to
the German demands without signing a treaty.
Meanwhile the Russian Constituent Assembly
which met at Petrograd on January 19th, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
dissolved on January 20th, by the Bolsheviki
Council.</p>

<p>Disorders continued throughout all Russia
and counter-revolutionary movements were
started at many places. On February 18th,
the day when the armistice agreement between
Russia and the Central Powers expired, German
forces began a new invasion of Russia.
The next day the Bolshevist Government issued
a statement, announcing that Russia
would be compelled to sign a peace. The German
advance went on rapidly, and many important
Russian cities were occupied. On
February 24th, the Bolshevist Government announced
that peace terms had been accepted,
and a treaty was signed at Brest-Litovsk on
March 3rd.</p>

<p>On March 14th the All-Russia Council of
Soviets voted to ratify the treaty, after an all-night
sitting. Lenine pronounced himself in
favor of accepting the German terms; Trotzky
stood for war, but did not attend the meetings
of the Council. Lenine defended the step by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
pointing out that the country was completely
unable to offer resistance, and that peace was
indispensable for the completion of the social
war in Russia.</p>

<p>With the collapse of Russia German forces advanced from Riga, along

</figure>

<p>The new treaty dispossessed Russia of territories
amounting to nearly one-quarter of the
area of European Russia, and inhabited
by one-third of Russia’s total population.
Trotzky resigned on account of his opposition
to the treaty and was succeeded by M. Tchitcherin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
He became Chairman of the Petrograd
Labor Commune. The treaty between
Russia and the Central Powers was formally
denounced by the Premiers and Foreign Ministers
of Great Britain, France, and Italy, and
was not recognized by the Allied nations.</p>

<p>A final revocation of its provisions by both
sides did not put an end to the military operations
of the Central Powers in Russia, nor did
the Russians cease to make feeble and sporadic
attempts at resistance. Germany was forced
to keep large bodies of troops along the Russian
front, but formally Russia’s part in the
war had come to an end.</p>

<span class="smcap">Germany’s Object Lesson to the United States</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DURING the first two years of the war
many Americans, especially those in the
West, observed the great events which were
happening with great interest, no doubt, but
with a feeling of detachment. The war was
a long way off. The Atlantic Ocean separated
Europe from America, and it seemed
almost absurd to think that the Great War
could ever affect us.</p>

<p>In the year 1916, however, two events happened
which seemed to bring the war to our
door. The first was the arrival at Baltimore,
on July 9th, of the Deutschland, a German
submarine of great size, built entirely for commercial
purposes, and the second was the appearance,
on the 7th of October, of a German
war submarine in the harbor at Newport,
Rhode Island, and its exploit on the following
day when it sunk a number of British and neutral
vessels just outside the three-mile line on
the Atlantic coast.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CARGO SUBMARINE “DEUTSCHLAND”</p>

<p>Shortly before the United States entered the war, Germany sent over a merchant submarine with a cargo of dye stuffs and drugs,
an implied threat which was later realized in the U-boat attacks on the American coast.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>The performances of these two vessels were
equally suggestive, but the popular feeling
with regard to what they had done was very
divergent. The voyage of the Deutschland
roused the widest admiration but the action of
the U-53 stirred up the deepest indignation.
Yet the voyages of each showed with equal
clearness that, however much America might
consider herself separated from the Great
War, the new scientific invention, the submarine,
had annihilated space, and America, too,
was now but a neighbor of the nations at war.</p>

<p>The voyage of the Deutschland was a romance
in itself. It was commanded by Captain
Paul Koenig, a German officer of the old
school. He had been captain of the Schleswig
of the North German Lloyd, and of other
big liners. When the power of the British
fleet drove German commerce from the seas, he
had found himself without a job, and, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
phrased it, “was drifting about the country
like a derelict.” One day, in September, 1915,
he was asked to meet Herr Alfred Lohmann,
an agent of the North German Lloyd Line,
and surprised by an offer to navigate a submarine
cargo ship from Germany to America.
Captain Koenig, who seems to have been in
every way an admirable personage, at once
consented. He has told us the story of his
trip in his interesting book called “The Voyage
of the Deutschland.”</p>

<p>The Deutschland itself was three hundred
feet long, thirty feet wide, and carried one
thousand tons of cargo and a crew of twenty-nine
men. It cost a half a million dollars, but
paid for itself in the first trip. According to
Captain Koenig the voyage on the whole seems
to have been most enjoyable. He understood
his boat well and had watched its construction.
Before setting out on his voyage he carefully
trained his crew, and experimented with the
Deutschland until he was thoroughly familiar
with all its peculiarities. The cargo was composed
of dye stuffs, and the ship was well supplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
with provisions and comforts. In his
description of the trip he lays most emphasis
upon the discomfort resulting from heavy
weather and from storms. He was able to
avoid all danger from hostile ships by the very
simple process of diving. No English ship
approached him closely as he was always able
to see them from a distance, usually observing
their course by means of their smoke.</p>

<p>One of his liveliest adventures, however, occurred
when attempting to submerge suddenly
during a heavy sea on the appearance of a destroyer.
The destroyer apparently never observed
the Deutschland, but in the endeavor
to dive quickly the submarine practically stood
on its head, and dived down into the mud,
where it found itself held fast. Captain
Koenig however was equal to the emergency,
and by balancing and trimming the tanks he
finally restored the center of gravity and released
his boat.</p>

<p>A considerable portion of his trip was
passed upon the surface as he only submerged
when there was suspicion of danger. According<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
to his story his men kept always in the
highest spirits. They had plenty of music,
and doubtless appreciated the extraordinary
nature of their voyage.</p>

<p>An amusing incident during the trip was the
attempt to camouflage his ship by a framework,
made of canvas and so constructed as to
give the outline of a steamer. One day a hostile
steamer appeared in the distance and Captain
Koenig proceeded to test his disguise.
After great difficulties, especially in connection
with the production of smoke, he finally
had the whole construction fairly at work.
The steamer, which had been peacefully going
its way, on seeing the new ship suddenly
changed her course and steered directly toward
the Deutschland. It evidently took the
Deutschland for some kind of a wreck and
was hurrying to give it assistance. Captain
Koenig at once pulled off his super-structure
and revealed himself as a submarine, and the
strange vessel veered about and hurried off as
fast as it could.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the Deutschland in America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
Captain Koenig and his crew found their
difficulties over. All arrangements had been
made by representatives of the North German
Lloyd for their safety and comfort. As they
ran up Chesapeake Bay they were greeted by
the whistles of the neutral steamers that they
passed. The moving-picture companies immortalized
the crew and they were treated with
the utmost hospitality.</p>

<p>The Allied governments protested that the
Deutschland was really a war vessel and on the
12th of July a commission of three American
naval officers was sent down from Washington
to make an investigation. The investigation
showed the Deutschland was absolutely
unarmed and the American Government decided
not to interfere.</p>

<p>The position of the Allies was that a submarine,
even though without guns or torpedoes,
was practically a vessel of war from its very
nature, and for it to pretend to be a merchant
vessel was as if some great German man-of-war
should dismount its guns and pass them
over to some tender and then undertake to visit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
an American port. They argued that if the
submarine would come out from harbor it
might be easily fitted with detachable torpedo
tubes, and become as dangerous as any U-boat.
Even without arms it might easily sink an unarmed
merchant vessel by ramming. But the
United States was not convinced, and American
citizens rather admired the genial captain.</p>

<p>His return was almost as uneventful as his
voyage out. At the very beginning he had
trouble in not being able to rise after an experimental
dive. This misadventure was caused
by a plug of mud which had stopped up the
opening of the manometer. But the difficulty
was overcome, and he was able to pass under
water between the British ships which were on
the lookout. His return home was a triumph.
Hundreds of thousands of people gathered
along the banks of the Weser, filled with the
greatest enthusiasm. Poems were written in
his honor and his appearance was everywhere
greeted with enthusiastic applause. The Germans
felt sure that through the Deutschland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
and similar boats they had broken the British
blockade.</p>

<p>Captain Koenig made a second voyage,
landing at New London, Connecticut, on November
1st, where he took on a cargo of rubber,
nickel and other valuable commodities.
On November 16th, in attempting to get away
to sea, he met with a collision with the tug
T. A. Scott, Jr., and had to return to New
London for repairs. He concluded his voyage,
however, without difficulty. In spite of
his success the Germans did not make any very
great attempt to develop a fleet of submarine
cargo boats. It was commonly reported that
at least one sister vessel was either captured by
the British or was lost at sea, and in the latter
years of the war the gradual entrance of America
into the conflict of course prevented any
further developments of this form of trade.</p>

<p>The other German act which brought home
to Americans the possibilities of the submarine,
the visit of the U-53, was a very different sort
of matter. U-53 was a German submarine of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
the largest type. On October 7, 1916, it made
a sudden appearance at Newport, and its captain,
Lieutenant-Captain Hans Rose, was entertained
as if he were a welcome guest. He
sent a letter to the German Ambassador at
Washington and received visitors in his beautiful
boat. The U-53 was a war submarine,
two hundred and thirteen feet long, with two
deck guns and four torpedo tubes. It had
been engaged in the war against Allied commerce
in the Mediterranean. Captain Rose
paid formal visits to Rear-Admiral Austin
Knight, Commander of the United States
Second Naval District, stationed at Newport,
and Rear-Admiral Albert Gleaves, Commander
of the American destroyer flotilla at
that place, and then set out secretly to his
destination.</p>

<p>On the next day the news came in that the
U-53 had sunk five merchant vessels. These
were the Strathdene, which was torpedoed; the
West Point, a British freighter, also torpedoed;
the Stephano, a passenger liner between
New York and Halifax, which the submarine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
attempted to sink by opening its sea
valves but was finally torpedoed; the Blommersdijk,
a Dutch freighter, and the Christian
Knudsen, a Norwegian boat. The American
steamer Kansan was also stopped, but allowed
to proceed. When the submarine began its
work wireless signals soon told what was happening,
and Admiral Knight, with the Newport
destroyer flotilla, hurried to the rescue.
These destroyers picked up two hundred and
sixteen men and acted with such promptness
that not a single life was lost.</p>

<p>The action of the U-53 produced intense excitement
in America. The newspapers were
filled with editorial denunciation, and the people
were roused to indignation. The American
Government apparently took the ground
that the Germans were acting according to law
and according to their promise to America.
They had given warning in each case and allowed
the crews of the vessels which they sunk
to take to their boats. This was believed to
be a fulfilment of their pledge “not to sink
merchant vessels without warning and without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
saving human lives, unless the ship attempts
to escape or offers resistance.”</p>

<p>The general feeling, however, of American
public opinion, was that it was a brutal act.
In the case of the Stephano there were ninety-four
passengers. These, together with the
crew, were placed adrift in boats at eight
o’clock in the evening, in a rough sea sixty
miles away from the nearest land. If the
American destroyer fleet had not rushed to the
rescue it is extremely likely that a great many
of these boats would never have reached land.
The German Government did not save these
human lives. It was the American navy
which did that. But, technicalities aside, the
pride of the American people was wounded.
They could not tolerate a situation in which
American men-of-war should stand idly by
and watch a submarine in a leisurely manner
sink ships engaged in American trade whose
passengers and crews contained many American
citizens.</p>

<p>It was another one of those foolish things
that Germans were constantly doing, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
gave them no appreciable military advantage,
but stirred up against them the sentiment of
the world. The Germans perhaps were anxious
to show the power of the submarines, and
to give America an object lesson in that power.
They wished to make plain that they could destroy
overseas trade, and that if the United
States should endeavor to send troops across
the water they would be able to sink those
troops.</p>

<p>The Germans probably never seriously contemplated
a blockade of the American coast.
The U-53 returned to its base and the danger
was ended. American commerce went peacefully
on, and the net result of the German audacity
was in the increase of bitterness in the
popular feeling toward the German methods.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<span class="smcap">America Transformed by War</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Germany threw down the gauge
of battle to the civilized world, the German
High Command calculated that the long,
rigorous and thorough military training to
which every male German had submitted,
would make a military force invincible in the
field. The High Command believed that a
nation so trained would carve out victory after
victory and would end the World War before
any nation could train its men sufficiently to
check the Teutonic rush.</p>

<p>To that theory was opposed the democratic
conception that the free nations of earth could
train their young men intensively for six
months and send these vigorous free men into
the field to win the final decision over the hosts
of autocracy.</p>

<p>These antagonistic theories were tried out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
to a finish in the World War and the theory of
democracy, developed in the training camps of
America, Canada, Australia, Britain, France
and Italy, triumphed. Especially in the training
camps of America was the German theory
disproved. There within six months the best
fighting troops on earth were developed and
trained in the most modern of war-time practices.
Everything that Germany could devise
found its answer in American ingenuity,
American endurance and American skill.</p>

<p>The entrance of America into the tremendous
conflict on April 6, 1917, was followed
immediately by the mobilization of the entire
nation. Business and industry of every character
were represented in the Council of National
Defense which acted as a great central
functioning organization for all industries and
agencies connected with the prosecution of the
war. Executives of rare talent commanding
high salaries tendered their services freely to
the government. These were the “dollar a
year men” whose productive genius was to bear
fruit in the clothing, arming, provisioning, munitioning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
and transportation of four million
men and the conquest of Germany by a veritable
avalanche of war material.</p>

<p>Out of the ranks of business and science
came Hurley, Schwab, Piez, Coonley to drive
forward a record-breaking shipbuilding program,
Stettinus to speed up the manufacture
of munitions, John W. Ryan to coordinate and
accelerate the manufacture of airplanes, Vance
C. McCormick and Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor to
solve the problems of the War Trade Board,
Hoover to multiply food production, to conserve
food supplies and to place the army and
citizenry of America upon food rations while
maintaining the morale of the Allies through
scientific food distribution and a host of other
patriotic civilians who put the resources of the
nation behind the military and naval forces
opposed to Germany. Every available loom
was put at work to make cloth for the army
and the navy, the leather market was drained
of its supplies to shoe our forces with wear
adapted to the drastic requirements of modern
warfare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>German capital invested in American
plants was placed under the jurisdiction of
A. Mitchell Palmer as Alien Property Custodian.
German ships were seized and transformed
into American transports. Physicians
over military age set a glorious example of
patriotic devotion by their enlistment in thousands.
Lawyers and citizens generally in the
same category as to age entered the office of
the Judge Advocate General or the ranks of
the Four Minute Men or the American Protective
League which rendered great service
to the country in exposing German propaganda
and in placing would-be slackers in military
service. Bankers led the mighty Liberty
Loan and War Savings Stamp drives and unselfishly
placed the resources of their institutions
at the service of the government.</p>

<p>Women and children rallied to the flag with
an intensity of purpose, sacrifice and effort that
demonstrated how completely was the heart
of America in the war. Work in shops, fields,
hospitals, Red Cross work rooms and elsewhere
was cheerfully and enthusiastically performed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
and the sacrifices of food rationing,
higher prices, lightless nights, gasolineless Sundays,
diminished steam railway and trolley
service were accepted with a multitude of
minor inconveniences without a murmur. Congress
had a free hand in making appropriations.
The country approved without a minute’s
hesitation bills for taxation that in other
days would have brought ruin to the political
party proposing them. Billions were voted to
departments where hundreds of thousands had
been the rule.</p>

<p>The true temper of the American people was
carefully hidden from the German people by
the German newspapers acting under instructions
from the Imperial Government. Instead
of the truth, false reports were printed
in the newspapers of Berlin and elsewhere that
the passage of the American conscription law
had been followed by rioting and rebellion in
many places and that fully fifty per cent of
the American people was opposed to the declaration
of war. The fact that the selective
service act passed in May, 1917, was accepted
by everybody in this country as a wholly equitable
and satisfactory law did not permeate
into Germany until the first American Expeditionary
Force had actually landed in France.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THE UNITED STATES AN ARMED CAMP</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>America’s fighting power was demonstrated
conclusively to the Germanic intellect at
Seicheprey, Bouresches Wood, Belleau Wood,
Château-Thierry, and in the Forest of the Argonne.
Especially was it demonstrated when
it came to fighting in small units, or in individual
fighting. The highly disciplined and
highly trained German soldiers were absolutely
unfitted to cope with Americans, Canadians
and Australians when it came to matching individual
against individual, or small group
against small group.</p>

<p>This was shown in the wild reaches of the
Forest of the Argonne. There the machine-gun
nests of the Germans were isolated and
demolished speedily. Small parties of Germans
were stalked and run down by the relentless
Americans. On the other hand, the
Germans could make no headway against the
American troops operating in the Forest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
The famous “Lost Battalion” of the 308th
United States Infantry penetrated so far in
advance of its supports that it was cut off for
four days without food, water or supplies of
munitions in the Argonne. The enemy had
cut its line of communication and was enforced
both in front and in the rear. Yet the lost battalion,
comprising two companies armed with
rifles and the French automatic rifle known
as the Chauchat gun, called by the doughboys
“Sho Sho,” held out against the best the overpowering
forces of the Germans could send
against them, and were ultimately rescued
from their dangerous position.</p>

<p>The training of the Americans was also in
modern efficiency that made America prominent
in the world of industry. The reduction
of the German salient at St. Mihiel was an object
lesson to the Germans in American methods.
General Pershing commanding that operation
in person, assembled the newspaper
correspondents the day before the drive.
Maps were shown, giving the extent and locale
of the attack. The correspondents were invited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
to follow the American troops and a time
schedule for the advance was given to the various
corps commanders.</p>

<p>In that operation, 152 square miles of territory
and 72 villages were captured outright.
For the reduction of the German defenses and
for the creeping barrage preceding the American
advance, more than 1,500,000 shells were
fired by the artillery. Approximately 100,000
detail maps and 40,000 photographs prepared
largely from aerial observations, were issued
for the guidance of the artillery and the infantry.
These maps and photographs detailed
all the natural and artificial defenses of
the entire salient. More than 5,000 miles of
telephone wire was laid by American engineers
immediately preceding the attack, and as the
Americans advanced on the morning of the
battle, September 12, 1918, 6,000 telephone
instruments were connected with this wire.
Ten thousand men were engaged in operating
the hastily constructed telephone system;
3,000 carrier pigeons supplemented this work.</p>

<p>During the battle American airplanes swept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
the skies clear of enemy aircraft and signalled
instructions to the artillery, besides attacking
the moving infantry, artillery and supply
trains of the enemy. So sure were the Americans
of their success that moving-picture operators
took more than 10,000 feet of moving-picture
film showing the rout of the Germans.
Four thousand eight hundred trucks carried
food, men and munitions into the lines. Miles
of American railroads, both of standard and
narrow gauge, carrying American-made equipment,
assisted in the transportation of men
and supplies. Hospital facilities including 35
hospital trains, 16,000 beds in the advanced
sector, and 55,000 other beds back of the fighting
line, were prepared. Less than ten per
cent of this hospital equipment was used.</p>

<p>As the direct consequence of this preparation,
which far outstripped anything that any
other nation had attempted in a similar offensive,
the Americans with a remarkably small
casualty list took 15,188 prisoners, 111 guns,
many of them of large calibre, immense quantities
of munitions and other supplies, and inflicted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
heavy death losses upon the fleeing Germans.</p>

<p>Two selective service laws operated as manhood
conscription. The first of these took men
between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-one
years inclusive. June 5, 1917, was fixed as
registration day. The total number enrolled
was 9,586,508. The first selective army drawn
from this number was 625,000 men.</p>

<p>The second selective service legislation embraced
all citizens between the ages of 18 and
45 inclusive, not included in the first draft.
Over 13,000,000 men enrolled on September
12, 1918.</p>

<p>The grand total of registrants in both drafts
was 23,456,021. Youths who had not completed
their 19th year were set apart in a group
to be called last and men between thirty-six
and forty-five were also put in a deferred class.
The government’s plan was to have approximately
5,000,000 men under arms before the
summer of 1919. The German armistice on
November 11th found 4,000,000 men actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
under arms and an assignment of 250,000
made to the training camps.</p>

<p>A most important factor in the training
plans of the United States was that incorporated
in the organization of the Students’
Army Training Corps, by which 359 American
colleges and universities were taken over
by the Government and 150,000 young men
entered these institutions for the purpose of
becoming trained soldiers. The following are
the conditions under which the S. A. T. C. was
organized:</p>

<p>The War Department undertook to furnish
officers, uniforms, rifles, and equipment, and
to assign the student to military duty, after
a few months, either at an officers’ training
camp or in some technical school, or in a regular
army cantonment with troops as a private,
according to the degree of aptitude shown on
the college campus.</p>

<p>At the same time a circular letter to the
Presidents of colleges arranged for a contract
under which the Government became responsible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
for the expense of the housing, subsistence,
and instruction of the students. The preliminary
arrangement contained this provision,
among others:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The per diem rate of $1 for subsistence and housing
is to govern temporarily, pending examination of the
conditions in the individual institution and a careful
working out of the costs involved. The amount so fixed
is calculated from the experience of this committee during
the last five months in contracting with over 100
collegiate institutions for the housing and subsistence of
over 100,000 soldiers in the National Army Training
Detachment. This experience indicates that the average
cost of housing is 15 to 20 cents per day; subsistence,
(army ration or equivalent,) 70 to 80 cents per day.
The tuition charge is based on the regular per diem tuition
charge of the institution in the year 1917-18.</p>
</div>

<p>A permanent contract was arranged later
under these governing principles:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The basis of payment will be reimbursement for actual
and necessary costs to the institutions for the services
rendered to the Government in the maintenance and instruction
of the soldiers with the stated limitation as to
cost of instruction. Contract price will be arrived at by
agreement after careful study of the conditions in each
case, in conference with authorities of the institution.</p>

<p>The War Department will have authority to specify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
and control the courses of instruction to be given by the
institution.</p>

<p>The entity and power for usefulness of the institutions
will be safeguarded so that when the contract ends
the institutions shall be in condition to resume their
functions of general education.</p>

<p>The teaching force will be preserved so far as practicable,
and this matter so treated that its members
shall feel that in changing to the special intensive work
desired by the Government they are rendering a vital and
greatly needed service.</p>

<p>The Government will ask from the institutions a specific
service; that is, the housing, subsistence, and instruction
along specified lines of a certain number of
student soldiers. There will be no interference with the
freedom of the institution in conducting other courses in
the usual way.</p>

<p>The contract will be for a fixed term, probably nine
months, subject to renewal for a further period on
reasonable notice, on terms to be agreed upon and subject
to cancellation on similar terms.</p>
</div>

<p>The story of the life of the American army
behind the lines in France would fill a volume.
The hospitality of the French people had
something pathetic in it. They were expecting
miracles of their new Allies. They were
war sick. Nearly all of them had lost some
father, or brother, or husband, and here came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
these big, hearty, joyous soldiers, full of ardor
and confident of victory. It put a new spirit
into all France. Their reception when they
first landed was a scene of such fervor and
enthusiasm as had never been known before
and probably will not be known again. Soon
the American soldier, in his khaki, with his
wide-brimmed soft hat, became a common
sight.</p>

<p>The villagers put up bunting, calico signs,
flags and had stocks of American canned goods
to show in their shop windows. The children,
when bold, played with the American soldiers,
and the children that were more shy ventured
to go up and touch an American soldier’s leg.
Very old peasant ladies put on their Sunday
black, and went out walking, and in some mysterious
way talking with American soldiers.
The village Mayors turned out and made
speeches, utterly incomprehensible to the
American soldiers.</p>

<p>The engineering, building and machinery
works the Americans put up were astonishing.
Gangs of workers went over in thousands;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
many of these were college men. They dug
and toiled as efficiently as any laborer. One
American Major told with glee how a party of
these young workers arrived straight from
America at 3.30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> and started digging at
5 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> next morning, “and they liked it, it
tickled them to death.” Many of these
draftees, in fact, were sick and tired of inaction
in ports before their departure from America,
and they welcomed work in France as if it were
some great game.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest work of all the Americans
performed was a certain aviation camp
and school. In a few months it was completed,
and it was the biggest of its kind in the
world. The number of airplanes used merely
for training was in itself remarkable. The
flying men—or boys—who had, of course, already
been broken-in in America, did an additional
course in France, and when they left
the aviation camp they were absolutely ready
for air-fighting at the front. This was the
finishing school. The aviators went through
eight distinct courses in the school. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
were perfected in flying, in observation, in
bombing, in machine-gun firing. On even a
cloudy and windy day the air overhead buzzed
with these young American flyers, all getting
into the pink of condition to do their stunts
at the front. They lived in the camp, and it
required moving heaven and earth for one of
them to get leave to go even to the nearest little
quiet old town.</p>

<p>An impression of complete businesslike determination
was what one got when visiting
the Americans in France. A discipline even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
stricter than that which applied in British and
French troops was in force. In towns, officers,
for instance, were not allowed out after 9 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>
Some towns where subalterns discovered the
wine of the country were instantly put “out
of bounds.” No officer, on any pretext whatsoever,
was allowed to go to Paris except on
official business. From the camps they were
not even allowed to go to the neighboring
towns.</p>

<p>The postal censors who read the letters of
the American Expeditionary Force were required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
to know forty-seven languages! Of
these languages, the two least used were Chinese
and German.</p>

<p>The announcement of the organization of
the first American Field Army was contained
in the following dispatch from France, August
11, 1918:</p>

<p>“The first American field army has been organized.
It is under the direct command of
General John J. Pershing, Commander-in-Chief
of the American forces. The corps
commanders thus far announced are Major
Generals Liggett, Bullard, Bundy, Read, and
Wright.</p>

<p>“The creation of the first field army is the
first step toward the co-ordination of all the
American forces in France. This does not
mean the immediate withdrawal from the British
and French commands of all American
units, and it is probable that divisions will be
used on the French and British fronts for
weeks yet. It is understood, however, that the
policy of organizing other armies will be carried
out steadily.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>This announcement marked a milestone in
the military effort of the United States.
When the American troops first arrived in
France, they were associated in small units
with the French to get primary training with
the armies then in the field.</p>

<p>Gradually regiments began to function under
French division commanders. Then American
divisions were formed and trained under
French corps commanders. Next, American
corps began to operate under French army
commanders. Finally, the first American
army was created, because enough divisions
and corps had been graduated from the school
of experience.</p>

<p>An American division numbers 30,000 men,
and a corps consists of six divisions, two
of which play the part of reserves. With
auxiliary troops, air squadrons, tank sections,
heavy artillery, and other branches, a corps
numbers from 225,000 to 250,000 men.</p>

<p>The following were the general officers temporarily
assigned to command the first five
corps:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>First corps—Major General Hunter Liggett.</p>

<p>Second corps—Major General Robert L.
Bullard.</p>

<p>Third corps—Major General William M.
Wright.</p>

<p>Fourth corps—Major General George W.
Read.</p>

<p>Fifth corps—Major General Omar Bundy.</p>

<p>Seven divisions and one separate regiment
of American troops participated in the counter-offensive
between Château-Thierry and
Soissons and in resisting the German attack in
the Champagne, it was officially stated on July
20. The 42nd, or “Rainbow” Division, composed
of National Guard troops from twenty-six
States and the District of Columbia, including
the New York 69th Infantry, now designated
as the 165th Infantry, took part in the
fighting in the Champagne east of Rheims.
The six other divisions were associated with the
French in the counter-offensive between
Château-Thierry and Soissons. These divisions
were the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
Regular Army, the 26th National Guard Division,
composed of troops from the six New
England States, and the 28th, composed of the
Pennsylvania National Guard. Marines were
included in this number. The separate regiment
that fought in the Champagne was a
negro unit attached to the new 93rd Division,
composed entirely of negro troops. It was
also announced that the 77th Division was “in
the line near Lunéville” and was “operating as
a division, complete under its own commander.”</p>

<p>The 42nd Division had the distinction, General
March announced on August 3d, of defeating
the 4th Division of the crack Prussian
Guards, professional soldiers of the German
standing army, who had never before failed.
General March also disclosed the fact that another
American division had been sent into
that part of the Rheims salient where the Germans
showed resistance. This was the 32nd
Division. “The American divisions in the
Rheims salient,” General March said, “have
now been put in contiguously and are actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
getting together as an American force.
Southeast of Fère-en-Tardenois our 1st Corps
is operating, with General Liggett in actual
command.”</p>

<p>The organization of twelve new divisions was
announced by General March, Chief of Staff,
in statements made on July 24th and July 31st.
These divisions were numerically designated
from 9 to 20, and organized at Camps Devens,
Meade, Sheridan, Custer, Funston, Lewis,
Logan, Kearny, Beauregard, Travis, Dodge,
and Sevier. Each division had two infantry
regiments of the regular army as nucleus, the
other elements being made up of drafted men.
The new divisions moved into the designated
camps as the divisions already trained there
moved out.</p>

<p>The composition of an American division is
as follows:</p>

<p>Two brigades of infantry, each consisting
of two regiments of infantry and one machine-gun
battalion.</p>

<p>One brigade of artillery, consisting of three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
regiments of field artillery, and one trench
mortar battery.</p>

<p>One regiment of engineers.</p>

<p>One field signal battalion.</p>

<p>The following trains: Headquarters and
military police, sanitary, supply, engineer, and
ammunition.</p>

<p>The following division units: Headquarters
troop and one machine-gun battalion.</p>

<p>A general order of the War Department
providing for the consolidation of all branches
of the army into one army to be known as the
“United States Army” was promulgated by
General March on August 7th. The text of
the order read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. This country has but one army—the United States
Army. It includes all the land forces in the service of
the United States. Those forces, however raised, lose
their identity in that of the United States Army. Distinctive
appellations, such as the Regular Army, Reserve
Corps, National Army, and National Guard, heretofore
employed in administration command, will be discontinued,
and the single term, the United States Army,
will be exclusively used.</p>

<p>2. Orders having reference to the United States Army
as divided in separate and component forces of distinct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
origin, or assuming or contemplating such a division, are
to that extent revoked.</p>

<p>3. The insignia now prescribed for the Regular Army
shall hereafter be worn by the United States Army.</p>

<p>4. All effective commissions purporting to be, and
described therein, as commissions in the Regular Army,
National Guard, National Army, or the Reserve Corps,
shall hereafter be held to be, and regarded as commissions
in the United States Army—permanent, provisional, or
temporary, as fixed by the conditions of their issue; and
all such commissions are hereby amended accordingly.
Hereafter during the period of the existing emergency
all commissions of officers shall be in the United States
Army and in staff corps, departments, and arms of the
service thereof, and shall, as the law may provide, be
permanent, for a term, or for the period of the emergency.
And hereafter during the period of the existing emergency
provisional and temporary appointments in the
grade of Second Lieutenant and temporary promotions
in the Regular Army and appointments in the Reserve
Corps will be discontinued.</p>

<p>5. While the number of commissions in each grade
and each staff corps, department, and arm of the service
shall be kept within the limits fixed by law, officers shall
be assigned without reference to the term of their commissions
solely in the interest of the service; and officers
and enlisted men will be transferred from one organization
to another as the interests of the service may require.</p>

<p>6. Except as otherwise provided by law, promotion in
the United States Army shall be by selection. Permanent
promotions in the Regular Army will continue to
be made as prescribed by law.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<span class="smcap">How Food Won the War</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOOD won the war. Without the American
farmer the Entente Allies must have
capitulated. Wheat, beef, corn, foods of
every variety, hermetically sealed in tins, were
thrown into the scales on the side of the Entente
Allies in sufficient quantities to tip the
balance toward the side of civilization and
against autocracy. Late in the fall of 1918
when victory was assured to America and the
Allies, there was received this message of appreciation
from General Pershing to the farmers
of America, through Carl Vrooman, Assistant
Secretary of Agriculture:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">American Expeditionary Forces</span>, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br>
Office of the Commander-in-Chief, France, &#160; &#160;<br>
October 16, 1918.</p>

<p>Honorable <span class="smcap">Carl Vrooman</span>, <i>Assistant Secretary of Agriculture</i>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Vrooman</span>:—Will you please convey to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
farmers of America our profound appreciation of their
patriotic services to the country and to the allied armies
in the field. They have furnished their full quota of
fighting men; they have bought largely of Liberty Bonds;
and they have increased their production of food crops
both last year and this by over a thousand million
bushels above normal production. Food is of vital military
necessity for us and for our Allies, and from the
day of our entry into the war America’s armies of food
producers have rendered invaluable service to the Allied
cause by supporting the soldiers at the front through
their devoted and splendidly successful work in the fields
and furrows at home.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Very sincerely,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">John J. Pershing</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>This tribute to the men and women on the
farms of America from the head of the American
forces in France is fit recognition of the
important part played by American food producers
in the war. It was early recognized by
all the belligerent powers that final victory
was a question of national morale and national
endurance. Morale could not be maintained
without food. The bread lines in Petrograd
gave birth to the revolution, and Russian
famine was the mother of Russian terrorism.
German men and women, starved of fats and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
sweets, deteriorated so rapidly that the crime
ratio both in towns and country districts
mounted appallingly. Conditions in Austria-Hungary
were even worse. Acute distress
arising from threatening famine was very
largely instrumental in driving Bulgaria out
of the war.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Germany’s greatest reliance
for a victorious decision lay in the
U-boat blockade of Great Britain, France and
Italy. Though some depredations came to
these countries, the submarine blockade never
fully materialized and with its failure Germany’s
hopes faded and died.</p>

<p>The Entente Allies and the United States
were fortunate in securing Herbert C. Hoover
to administer food distribution throughout
their lands and to stimulate food production
by the farmers of the United States. After
his signal success in the administration of the
Belgian Relief Commission, Mr. Hoover became
the unanimous choice of the Allies for the
victualing of the militant and civilian populations
after America’s entrance into the World<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
War. His work divided itself into three
heads:</p>

<p>First, stimulation of food production.</p>

<p>Second, elimination of food wastage in the
homes and public eating places of the country.</p>

<p>Third, education of food dealers and the
public in the use of foods that were substitutes
for wheat, rye, pork, beef and sugar.</p>

<p>After long and acrimonious debates in Congress,
Mr. Hoover, as Federal Food Administrator,
was clothed with extraordinary powers
enabling him to fulfil the purposes for which
he was appointed. The ability with which he
and his associates performed their work was
demonstrated in the complete débâcle of Bulgaria,
Turkey, Austria-Hungary and Germany.
These countries were starved out quite
as truly as they were fought out. The concrete
evidence of the Food Administration’s
success is shown in the subjoined table which
indicates the increase over normal in exporting
of foodstuffs by the United States since it
became the food reservoir for the world on account
of the war.</p>

<a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> Wheat harvest 1917-18 was 200,217,333 bushels below the
average of the three previous years.

</div>

<p>Upon the same subject Mr. Hoover himself
after the harvest of 1918 said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is now possible to summarize the shipments of
foodstuffs from the United States to the allied countries
during the fiscal year just closed—practically the last
harvest year. These amounts include all shipments to
allied countries for their and our armies, the civilian
population, the Belgian relief, and the Red Cross.
The figures indicate the measure of effort of the American
people in support of allied food supplies.</p>

<p>The total value of these food shipments, which were in
the main purchased through, or with the collaboration
of the Food Administration, amounted to, roundly, $1,400,000,000
during the fiscal year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>The shipments of meats and fats (including meat
products, dairy products, vegetable oils, etc.) to allied
destinations were as follows:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>&#160;</td><td class="tdc"><span class="smcap">Pounds</span></td></tr>

<tr><td>Fiscal year 1916-17 &#160;</td><td class="tdr">           2,166,500,000</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdr" colspan="2">——————</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Increase</td><td class="tdr">844,600,000</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Our slaughterable animals at the beginning of the
last fiscal year were not appreciably larger in number
than the year before; and particularly in hogs, there
were probably less. The increase in shipments is due
to conservation and the extra weight of animals added
by our farmers.</p>

<p>The full effect of these efforts began to bear their
best results in the last half of the fiscal year, when the
exports to the Allies were 2,133,100,000 pounds, as
against 1,266,500,000 pounds in the same period of the
year before. This compares with an average of 801,000,000
pounds of total exports for the same half
years of the three-year pre-war period.</p>

<p>In cereals and cereal products reduced to terms of
cereal bushels, our shipments to allied destinations have
been:</p>

</table>

<p>Of these cereals our shipments of the prime breadstuffs
in the fiscal year 1917-18 to allied destinations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
were: Wheat, 131,000,000 bushels and rye 13,900,000
bushels, a total of 144,900,000 bushels.</p>

<p>The exports to allied destinations during the fiscal
year 1916-17 were: Wheat, 135,100,000 bushels and
rye 2,300,000 bushels, a total of 137,400,000 bushels.
In addition, some 10,000,000 bushels of 1917 wheat are
now in port for allied destinations or en route thereto.
The total shipments to allied countries from our last
harvest of wheat will be, therefore, about 141,000,000
bushels, or a total of 154,900,000 bushels of prime
breadstuffs.</p>

<p>In addition to this we have shipped some 10,000,000
bushels to neutrals dependent upon us and we have
received some imports from other quarters. A large
part of the other cereals exported has also gone into
war bread.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that since the urgent request
of the Allied Food Controllers early in the year for a
further shipment of 75,000,000 bushels from our 1917
wheat than originally planned, we shall have shipped
to Europe, or have en route, nearly 85,000,000 bushels.
At the time of this request our surplus was already more
than exhausted.</p>

<p>This accomplishment of our people in this matter
stands out even more clearly if we bear in mind that
we had available in the fiscal year 1916-17 from net
carry over and a surplus over our normal consumption
about 200,000,000 bushels of wheat which we were able
to export that year without trenching on our home
loaf. This last year, however, owing to the large failure
of the 1917 wheat crop we had available from net carry
over and production and imports only just about our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
normal consumption. Therefore our wheat shipments
to allied destinations represent approximately savings
from our own wheat bread.</p>

<p>These figures, however, do not fully convey the volume
of the effort and sacrifice made during the past year by
the whole American people. Despite the magnificent
effort of our agricultural population in planting a much
increased acreage in 1917, not only was there a very
large failure in wheat, but also the corn failed to mature
properly, and corn is our dominant crop.</p>

<p>We calculate that the total nutritional production of
the country for the fiscal year just closed was between
seven per cent and nine per cent below the average of
the three previous years, our nutritional surplus for
export in those years being about the same amount as
the shrinkage last year. Therefore the consumption and
waste in food have been greatly reduced in every direction
during the year.</p>

<p>I am sure that the millions of our people, agricultural
as well as urban, who have contributed to these
results, should feel a very definite satisfaction that, in
a year of universal food shortage in the Northern
Hemisphere, all of these people joined together against
Germany have come through into sight of the coming
harvest not only with health and strength fully maintained,
but with only temporary periods of hardship.
The European Allies have been compelled to sacrifice
more than our own people, but we have not failed to
load every steamer since the delays of the storm months
of last winter.</p>

<p>Our contributions to this end could not have been
accomplished without effort and sacrifice, and it is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
matter for further satisfaction, that it had been accomplished
voluntarily and individually. It is difficult to
distinguish between various sections of our people—the
homes, public eating places, food trades, urban or
agricultural populations—in assessing credit for these
results, but no one will deny the dominant part of the
American woman.</p>
</div>

<p>But the work of the Food Administration
did not come to an end with the close of the
war. Insistent cries for food came from the
members of the defeated Teutonic alliance, as
well as from the suffering Allied and neutral
nations. To meet those demands, Mr. Hoover
sailed for Europe to organize the food relief
of the needy nations. The State Department,
explaining his mission, stated that as the first
measure of assistance to Belgium it was necessary
to increase immediately the volume of
foodstuffs formerly supplied, so as to physically
rehabilitate this under-nourished population.
The relief commission during the four
years of war sent to the 10,000,000 people in
the occupied area over 600 cargoes of food,
comprising 120,000,000 bushels of breadstuffs
and over 3,000,000,000 pounds of other foodstuffs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
besides 20,000,000 garments, the whole
representing an expenditure of nearly $600,000,000.
The support of the commission came
from the Belgian, British, French and American
governments, together with public charity.
In addition to this some $350,000,000 worth of
native produce was financed internally in Belgium
by the relief organization.</p>

<p>The second portion of Mr. Hoover’s mission
was to organize and determine the need of
foodstuffs to the liberated populations in
Southern Europe—the Czecho-Slovaks, the
Jugo-Slavs, and Serbians, Roumanians and
others.</p>

<p>To meet the conditions in Europe following
the armistice of November 11, 1918, the employment
service of the United States set to
work laying far-reaching plans for meeting the
problem of world food shortage.</p>

<p>Abnormal drought during the summer of
1918 seriously injured the Belgian, Italian and
French harvests, and appeals to the United
States for help were made.</p>

<p>And the appeals were not in vain. America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
took from her granaries the cereals needed to
stave off European famine. Germany was
cared for as well as those nations who had been
associated in arms with the United States.
The demands after the war were greater than
they had been during the conflict but the nation
that had fed the allies of civilization in
war time performed the task of feeding the
world, friend and foe alike, when peace at
length came upon the earth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<span class="smcap">The United States Navy in the War</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">LONG before war was declared the United
States Government had been engaged in
preparation. It had realized that unrestricted
submarine warfare was sure to lead to war,
and though for a time it was preserving what
it was pleased to call “an armed neutrality”
the President doubtless was well aware what
such an “armed neutrality” would lead to.
Merchant ships were being armed for protection
against the submarine, and crews from
the Navy assigned to work the guns. The
first collision was sure to mean an active state
of war. The Naval Department, therefore,
was working at full speed, getting the Navy
ready for active service as soon as war should
be declared.</p>

<p>Secretary Daniels made every effort to obtain
the crews that were necessary to man the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
new ships which were being fully commissioned
with the greatest possible speed and called
upon newspapers all through the country to do
their utmost to stimulate enlistment.</p>

<p>On March 26th President Wilson issued an
order increasing the enlisted strength of the
United States Marine Corps to 17,400 men,
the limit allowed under the law. On March
29th a hundred and three ensigns were graduated
from the Naval Academy three months
ahead of their time, and on April 6th, as soon
as war was declared, the Navy was mobilized.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes after Secretary Daniels
had signed the order for this purpose one
hundred code messages were sent out from the
office of Admiral W. S. Benson, Chief of
Naval Operations, which placed the Navy on a
war basis, and put into the control of the
Navy Department the naval militia of all the
states as well as the Naval Reserves and the
Coast Guard Service. In the Naval Militia
were about 584 officers, and 7,933 men. These
were at once assembled and assigned to coast
patrol service. All of the ships that were in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
active commission in the Navy were already
ready for duty. But there were reserve battleships
and reserve destroyers, besides ships
which had been out of commission which had
to be manned as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war there were 361
vessels ready for service, including twelve
first-line battleships, twenty-five second-line
battleships, nine armored cruisers, twenty-four
other cruisers, seven monitors, fifty destroyers,
sixteen coast torpedo vessels, seventeen torpedo
boats, forty-four submarines, eight tenders to
torpedo boats, twenty-eight gunboats, four
transports, four supply ships, one hospital ship,
twenty-one fuel ships, fourteen converted
yachts, forty-nine tugs, and twenty-eight minor
vessels. There were about seventy thousand
regularly enlisted men, besides eight thousand
five hundred members of the naval militia.
Many yachts together with their volunteer
crews had been offered to the government by
patriotic citizens.</p>

<p>For the complete mobilization of the Navy,
as it then stood, 99,809 regularly enlisted men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
and 45,870 reserves were necessary. About
twenty-seven thousand of these were needed
for coast defense, and twelve thousand at the
various shore stations. Retired officers were
called out, and assigned to duty which would
permit officers on the active list to be employed
in sea duty. The Navy therefore still lacked
thirty-five thousand men to bring it up to its
full authorized strength at the beginning, but
after the declaration of war an active recruiting
campaign brought volunteers by thousands.
The service was a popular one and
recruits were easily obtained.</p>

<p>One of the first phases of the mobilization
was the organization of a large fleet of mosquito
craft to patrol the Atlantic Coast, and
keep on the watch for submarines. Many of
these boats had been private yachts, and hundreds
of young men volunteered from the colleges
and schools of the country for this work.
Many boat builders submitted proposals to
construct small boats for this kind of patrol
duty, and on March 31st a coast patrol fleet
was organized by the Government under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
the command of Captain Henry B. Wilson.</p>

Coast-Line to Be Defended</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Navy took possession immediately on
the declaration of war of all wireless stations
in the United States dismantling all that could
not be useful to the Government. War zones
were established along the whole coast-line of
the United States, making a series of local
barred zones extending from the larger harbors
in American waters all along the line. These
harbors were barred at night to entering vessels
in order to guard against surprise by German
submarines. Contracts were awarded for
the construction of twenty-four destroyers even
before war was declared, and many more were
already under construction.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>The growth of the Navy in one year may
give some idea of the efficiency of the Navy
Department. In April, 1917, the regular
Navy contained 4,366 officers and 64,680 men.
In April, 1918, it contained 7,798 officers and
192,385 men. In the Marine Corps in 1917
there were 426 officers and 13,266 men. In
one year this was increased to 1,389 officers and
38,629 men. In the organization of the Naval
Reserves, naval volunteers and coast guards
there were in 1917, 24,569 men; in 1918, 98,319
men, and 11,477 officers.</p>

<p>While personnel of the Navy was thus expanding
the United States battle fleet had
grown to more than twice the size of the fleet
before the war. When war was declared there
were under construction 123 new naval vessels.
These were completed and contracts made for
949 new vessels. Among the ships completed
are fifteen battleships, six battle cruisers, seven
scout cruisers, twenty-seven destroyers, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
sixty-one submarines. About eight hundred
craft were taken over and converted into
transports, patrol service boats, submarine
chasers, mine sweepers and mine layers.</p>

<p>The Government also seized 109 German
ships which had been interned in American
ports. The Germans had attempted to damage
these ships so that they would be useless,
but they were all repaired, and carried American
troops and supplies in great quantities to
France.</p>

<p>As the fleet grew the training of the necessary
officers and crews was conducted on a
grand scale. Naval camps were established at
various points. The main ones were those at
Philadelphia, (League Island); Newport,
Rhode Island; Cape May, New Jersey;
Charleston, South Carolina; Pensacola, Florida;
Key West, Florida; Mare Island, California;
Puget Sound, Washington; Hingham,
Massachusetts; Norfolk, Virginia; New Orleans,
San Diego, New York Navy Yard,
Great Lakes, Illinois; Pelham, New York;
Hampton Roads, Virginia; and Gulfport,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
Mississippi. Schools in gunnery and engineering
were established and thousands of gunners
and engineers were trained, not only for
the Navy but for the armed merchant vessels.</p>

<p>The training of gun crews by target practice
was a feature of this work. Long before
the war began systematic training of this kind
had been done, but mainly in connection with
the big guns, and great efficiency had been
obtained by the steady practice. With the introduction
of the submarine, it became necessary
to pay special attention to the training of
the crews of guns of smaller calibre, and it
was not long before the officers of our Navy
were congratulating themselves on the efficiency
of their men. It is not easy to hit so
small a mark as the periscope of a submarine,
but it could be done and many times was done.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight days after the declaration of
war a fleet of United States destroyers under
the command of Admiral William S. Sims reported
for service at a British port.</p>

<p>The American destroyer squadron arrived
at Queenstown after a voyage without incident.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
The water front was lined with an excited
crowd carrying small American flags,
which cheered the destroyers from the time
they were first seen until they reached the dock.
They cheered again when Admiral Sims went
ashore to greet the British senior officer who
had come to welcome the Americans. It was a
most informal function. After the usual
handshakes the British Commander congratulated
the Americans on their safe voyage and
then asked:</p>

<p>“When will you be ready for business?”</p>

<p>“We can start at once,” was the prompt
reply of Admiral Sims.</p>

<p>This rather took the breath away from the
British Commander and he said he had not expected
the Americans to begin work so soon
after their long voyage. Later after a short
tour of the destroyers he admitted that the
American tars looked prepared.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the American Commander, “we
made preparations on the way over. That is
why we are ready.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe45" id="i_187">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_187.jpg" alt="“HAIL COLUMBIA”">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“HAIL COLUMBIA”</p>

<p>England greets the first American destroyer squadron to arrive in European waters after the United States entered the war. The
British admiral asked Admiral Sims, who was in command, how long he needed to refit and get ready for action. He replied “We are
ready now.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Everything on board the destroyers was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
excellent condition. The only thing lacking
was heavier clothing. The American uniforms
were too light for the cool weather which is
common in the English waters. This condition,
however, was quickly remedied, and the
American ships at once put out to sea all in
splendid condition and filled with the same enthusiasm
that the Marines showed later at
Château-Thierry.</p>

<p>“They are certainly a fine body of men, and
what’s more, their craft looked just as fit,” declared
the British Commander.</p>

<p>One of the American destroyers, even before
the American fleet had arrived at Queenstown,
had begun war duty. It had picked up
and escorted through the danger zone one of
the largest of the Atlantic liners. The passengers
on board the liner sent the Commander
of the destroyer the following message:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>British passengers on board a steamer, bound for a
British port, under the protection of an American destroyer,
send their hearty greetings to her Commander
and her officers and crew, and desire to express their keen
appreciation of this practical co-operation between the
government and people of the United States and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
British Empire, who are now fighting together for the
freedom of the seas.</p>
</div>

<p>Moving pictures were taken by the official
British Government photographer as the
American flotilla came into the harbor, and
sailors who received shore leave were plied
with English hospitality. The streets of
Queenstown were decorated with the Stars
and Stripes. As soon as American residents
in England learned that American warships
were to cross the Atlantic they held a conference
to provide recreation buildings, containing
sleeping, eating, and recreation accommodations
for the comfort of the American
sailors. The destroyer flotilla was the first
contribution of American military power to
the Entente Alliance against Germany.</p>

<p>Admiral Sims is one of the most energetic
and efficient of American Naval officers and
to him as much as to any other man is due the
efficiency of the American Navy. During
the period just before the Spanish-American
War Lieutenant Sims was Naval Attaché at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
Paris, and rendered invaluable services in buying
ships and supplies for the Navy. In 1900
he was assigned to duty on the Battleship
Kentucky, then stationed in the Orient. In
1902 he was ordered to the Navy Department
and placed in charge of the Office of Naval
Practice, where he remained for seven years
and devoted his attention to the improvement
of the Navy in gunnery. During that time
he made constant trips to England to consult
with English experts in gunnery and ordnance,
and became intimately acquainted with Sir
Percy Scott, who had been knighted and made
Rear-Admiral for the improvements he had
introduced in connection with the gunnery of
the British warships. In 1909 he was made
Commander of the Battleship Minnesota, and
in 1911 was a member of the college staff at
the Naval War College. In 1913 he was
made Commander of the torpedo flotilla of the
Atlantic fleet and in 1916 assigned to command
the Dreadnought Nevada. In 1916 he was
President of the Naval War College. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
made Rear-Admiral in 1916 and Vice-Admiral
in 1917 and assigned to the command of
all American war vessels abroad.</p>

<p>Immediately upon their arrival the American
vessels began operation in the submarine
zone. Admiral Beatty then addressed the following
message to Admiral Henry T. Mayo of
the United States Atlantic Fleet:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Grand Fleet rejoices that the Atlantic fleet will
now share in preserving the liberties of the world and
in maintaining the chivalry of the sea.</p>
</div>

<p>Admiral Mayo replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The United States Atlantic Fleet appreciates the
message from the British fleet and welcomes opportunities
for work with the British fleet for the freedom of
the seas.</p>
</div>

<p>It may also be noted, as a fact which is not
without significance, that the losses by submarine
which had reached their highest mark
in the last week in April began from that time
steadily to diminish.</p>

<p>One of the main duties of the Navy was to
convoy transports and supplies across the Atlantic.
This was done with the assistance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
Allied vessels with remarkable success. For a
long period it seemed as if the U-boats would
not be able to penetrate through the Allied
convoy, but during 1918 four transports were
torpedoed. The first was the Tuscania which
was sunk in February off the north coast of
Ireland, with 1,912 officers and men of the
Michigan and Wisconsin guardsmen, of whom
204 were lost. The Oronsa, which was torpedoed
in April, contained 250 men and all
were saved except three of the crew. The
Moldavia came next with five hundred troops,
of whom fifty-five were lost. On September
6th the troopship Persic with 2,800 American
soldiers was torpedoed but American destroyers
rescued all on board, and the Persic, which
was prevented from sinking by its water-tight
bulkheads, was afterwards beached.</p>

<p>Several American ships, including the troop
transport Mount Vernon, were torpedoed on
return trips and a number of the men of their
crews were lost, and several naval vessels were
lost, including the destroyer Jacob Jones, and
the patrol vessel Alcedo. The Cassin was torpedoed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
but reached port under its own steam
and later returned to service.</p>

<p>In September and October three more
American transports were added to the list of
American losses. On September 26th the
United States steamer Tampa was torpedoed
and sank with all on board, losing 118 men.
On September 30th the Ticonderoga was also
torpedoed, eleven Naval officers and 102 enlisted
men being lost.</p>

<p>In addition to these submarine losses several
ships and a number of men were lost through
collision. The United States steamer Westgate
was sunk in a collision with the steamer
American on October 7th, with the loss of seven
men. On October 9th the United States destroyer
Shaw lost fifteen men in a collision,
though she later succeeded in reaching port.
On October 11th the American steamer Otranto
was sunk in a collision with the British
liner Cashmere. Of seven hundred American
soldiers who were on board 365 were lost. At
this time about three thousand anti-submarine
craft were in operation day and night around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
the British Isles, and about five thousand working
in the open sea. This was what made it
possible for the Allies to win the war.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the illegal use of the submarine
by Germany brought America into the war
it was extremely appropriate that she should
take an active part in the suppression of the
submarine menace. The methods which were
used in fighting the submarines differed much
in different cases. The action of the government
in arming merchantmen and in providing
them with trained gun crews did much to
lower the number of such ships sunk by the
U-boats.</p>

<p>The submarine, which had formerly been
able to stop the unarmed merchantman and
sink him at leisure, after a few combats with
an armed merchantman began to be very wary
and to depend almost entirely upon his torpedoes.
It was not always easy for the submarine
to get in a position where her torpedo
would be effective, and the merchantman was
carefully directed, if attacked, to pursue a
zig-zag irregular course, and at the same time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
endeavor to hamper the submarine by shooting
as near her periscope as possible.</p>

<p>Along the sea coasts and at certain points in
the English Channel great nets were used effectively.
Submarines, however, toward the
end of the war were made sufficiently large to
be able to force their way through these nets,
and net-cutting devices were also used by them
with considerable effect. The best way to destroy
the submarines seemed to be in a direct
attack by flotillas or destroyers.</p>

<p>By the end of the war the whole process of
sinking or destroying submarines had been
thoroughly organized. Practically every portion
of the seas near Great Britain and France
was carefully watched and the appearance of
a submarine immediately reported. As the
submarine would only travel at a certain well-understood
speed during a given time, it was
possible to calculate, after the locality of one
was known, about how far from that point it
would be found at any later period. Destroyers
were therefore sent circling around the
point where the submarine had been discovered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
enlarging their distance from the center
every hour. In the course of time the submarine
would be compelled to come up for air,
and then, if luck were with the destroyer, it
might find its foe before it was seen itself.
Having discovered the submarine the destroyer
immediately endeavored to ram, dropping
depth bombs at the point where they supposed
the enemy to be.</p>

<p>These bombs were so constructed that at a
certain depth in the water they would explode,
and the force of the explosion was so great
that even if they did not strike the submarine
they would be sure to damage it seriously,
sometimes throwing the submarine to the surface
partly out of water, and at other times
driving her to come to the surface herself ready
to surrender.</p>

<p>In many cases it was not necessary to use the
depth bomb at all. The gunners on board the
destroyers had become extraordinarily expert,
and though a shot might destroy the periscope
of a submarine without doing much damage,
most submarines carrying extra periscopes to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
use if necessary, yet it was soon found that it
was possible by the use of plunging shells to
do effective damage. Plunging shells are
somewhat similar in their operation to bombs.
Such a shell falling just short of a periscope
and fused to burst both on contact and at a
certain depth was extremely likely to do damage.</p>

<p>In the pursuit of the U-boat the airplane
was also extremely effective. These were sent
out to patrol large districts near the Allied
coast, and also, in some cases, from ships themselves.
It is possible in certain weather conditions
for the observer on an airplane to detect
a submarine even when it is submerged
and the airplane can not only attack the submarine
by dropping depth bombs, but it can
signal at once the location of the enemy to the
hurrying destroyers. Indeed, as the submarine
warfare proceeded the main difficulty of
the Allies was to locate the submarines.
Many ingenious devices were used for this purpose,
and many of the English vessels had listening
attachments under water which were intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
to make it possible to hear a submarine
as it moved. These, however, do not seem to
have been very effective. The submarine itself
seems at times to have been fitted out in a
similar way and to have thus been able to hear
the sound of an approaching ship.</p>

<p>Many thrilling reports of naval actions
against German submarines were given out officially
by the British admiralty from time to
time. In most of these cases the submarine
was both rammed and attacked by depth
bombs. In nearly all of them the only proof
of success was the oil and air bubbles which
came to the surface.</p>

<p>One interesting encounter was that in which
a British submarine sighted a German U-boat,
while both were on the surface. The British
submarine dived and later was able to pick up
the enemy through the periscope and discharge
a torpedo in such a way as to destroy the German
vessel. When the British submarine
arose it found a patch of oil in which Germans
were swimming.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, however, a submarine was of little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
service in a fight against another for the
radius of sight from a periscope is so short
that it is practically blind so far as another
periscope is concerned. This blindness of the
submarine was taken advantage of by the Allies
in every possible way.</p>

<p>Merchant ships were camouflaged, that is
painted in such a way that they could not be
easily distinguished at a distance. In the great
convoys ships were often hidden by great
masses of smoke to prevent a submarine from
finding an easy mark. At night all lights
were put out or else so shaded as not to be seen
by the enemy. The result of these methods
was the gradual destruction of the U-boat
menace.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1918, while occasionally
some ship was lost, the production of new
ships was much greater than those that were
sunk. During the month of June it was announced
that the completion of new tonnage by
the Allies had outstripped the losses by thousands
of tons. During this period the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
States had attained its full stride in building
ships, airplanes and ordnance.</p>

<p>Archibald Hurd, the English naval expert,
said: “When the war is over the nation will
form some conception of the debt which we owe
the American navy for the manner in which
it has co-operated, not only in connection with
the convoy system, but in fighting the submarines.
If the naval position is improving
today, as it is, it is due to the fact that the
British and American fleets are working in
closest accord, supported by an immense body
of skilled workers on both sides of the Atlantic,
who are turning out destroyers and other
craft for dealing with the submarine, as well
as mines and bombs. Some of the finest battleships
of the United States navy are now associated
with the British Grand fleet. They
are not only splendid fighting ships but they
are well officered and manned.”</p>

<p>On May 13, 1918, in appreciation of some
remarks which had been made by Sir Eric
Geddes, First Lord of the British Admiralty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
Josephus Daniels, the American Secretary of
the Navy, addressed a letter to him in the following
terms:</p>

<p>“Your reference to the splendid spirit of co-operation
between the navies of our countries,
and your warm praise of the officers and men
of our navy, have been most grateful to me
and to all Americans. The brightest spot in
the tragedy of this war is this mutual appreciation
of the men in the naval service. Our
officers who have returned confirm the statements
of Admiral Sims of the courtesies and
kindness shown in every way by the admiralty
and the officers of the British fleet. I had
hoped to have the pleasure of visiting Great
Britain and of personally expressing this feeling
of mutual working together, but the task
here of making ready more and more units for
the fleet is a very serious one, and my duty
chains me here. The order in all the navy is
‘Full speed ahead’ in the construction of destroyers
and other craft, and the whole service
is keyed up to press this program forward.
Therefore I shall not have the pleasure, until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
this program shall materialize, of a personal
acquaintance and a conference which would be
of such interest and value.”</p>

<p>Sir Eric Geddes replied: “I am exceedingly
grateful for your letter. As you know
we, all of us here, have great admiration for
your officers and men, and for the splendid help
they are giving in European waters. Further,
we find Admiral Sims invaluable in council and
in co-operation. I fully appreciate how onerous
your office must be and much though I regret
that you do not see your way to visiting
this country in the near future, I hope we may
some day have the pleasure of welcoming you
here.”</p>

<p>Sir Eric afterward himself visited the United
States and his visit was made the occasion of
a general expression of the high regard which
the United States felt for the splendid assistance
which the great British navy had rendered
in convoying its armies across the seas.</p>

<p>From August, 1914, to September, 1918,
German submarines sank 7,157,088 deadweight
tons of shipping in excess of the tonnage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
turned out in that period by the allied and
neutral nations. That total does not represent
the depletion of the fleets at the command
of the allied and neutral nations, however, as
3,795,000 deadweight tons of enemy ships were
seized in the meantime. Actually, the allied
and neutral nations on September 1, 1918, had
only 3,362,088 less tons of shipping in operation
than in August, 1914.</p>

<p>These details of the shipping situation were
issued by the United States Shipping Board
along with figures to show that, with American
and allied yards under full headway, Europe’s
danger of being starved by the German
submarine was apparently at an end. The
United States took the lead of all nations in
shipbuilding.</p>

<p>In all, the allied and neutral nations lost
21,404,913 deadweight tons of shipping since
the beginning of the war, showing that Germany
maintained an average destruction of
about 445,000 deadweight tons monthly.
During the latter months, however, the sinkings
fell considerably below the average, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
allied construction passed destruction for the
first time in May, 1918.</p>

<p>The losses of the allied and neutral shipping
in August, 1918, amounted to 327,676
gross tonnage, of which 176,401 was British
and 151,275 allied and neutral, as compared
with the adjusted figures for July of 323,772,
and 182,524 and 141,248, respectively. British
losses from all causes during August were
10,887 tons higher than in June, which was
the lowest month since the introduction of unrestricted
submarine warfare.</p>

<p>An official statement of the United States
Shipping Board, issued September 21, 1918,
set forth the following facts:</p>

<p>The climax to Germany’s piratical submarine
adventure took place a few days after the
armistice, when a mournful procession of
shamefaced-looking U-boats sailed between
lines of English cruisers to be handed over to
the tender mercies of the Allied governments.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<span class="smcap">China Joins the Fighting Democracies</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE circumstances connected with the entrance
of the Republic of China into the
World War were as follows: On February
4, 1917, the American Minister, Dr. Reinsch,
requested the Chinese Government to follow
the United States in protesting against the
German use of the submarine against neutral
ships. On February 9th Pekin made such a
protest to Germany, and declared its intention
of severing diplomatic relations if the protest
were ineffectual. The immediate answer of
Germany was to torpedo the French ship Atlas
in the Mediterranean on which were over seven
hundred Chinese laborers. On March 10th the
Chinese Parliament empowered the government
to break with Germany. On the same
afternoon a reply was received from the German<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Government to the Chinese protest, of a
very mild character. The reply produced a
great deal of surprise in China.</p>

<p>A Chinese statesman made this comment on
the German change of attitude: “The troops
under Count Waldersee leaving Germany for
the relief of Pekin were instructed by the War
Lord to grant no quarter to the Chinese. On
the other hand, the latter were to be so disciplined
that they would never dare look a
German in the face again. The whirligig of
time brings its own revenge, and today, after
the lapse of scarcely seventeen years, we hear
the <i>Vossische Zeitung</i> commenting on the diplomatic
rupture between China and Germany,
lamenting that even so weak a state as the
Far Eastern Republic dares look defiantly
at the German nation.”</p>

<p>The breaking off of relations with Germany
led to trouble between the President of the Republic
and the Premier. The Premier desired
to break off relations without consulting
Parliament. The President insisted that
Parliament should be consulted, which was actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
done. The next move was to declare
war, but here the Chinese statesmen hesitated,
and their hesitation arose through their feeling
toward Japan.</p>

<p>They sympathized with the Allies, but to
Chinese eyes Japan had stood for all that Germany,
as depicted by its worst enemies, stood
for. The Japanese Government was professing
friendliness to China, but that profession
the Chinese could not reconcile with Japan’s
action in the Chino-Japanese War, and on
many other occasions since that war. In
Chinese hearts there was a strong feeling of
distrust, fear and hatred for their Japanese
neighbor. There were other reasons also why
they hesitated to declare war. Indeed the devotion
to peace, which is deep-rooted in the nation,
would be a sufficient reason in itself.</p>

<p>Moreover, China, like other neutral nations,
was a strong center for German propaganda.
German consuls and diplomatic officers, who
were scholars in Chinese literature and philosophy,
and who also had sufficient funds to entertain
Chinese officials as they liked to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
entertained, were actively endeavoring to influence
Chinese statesmen.</p>

<p>The Chinese Government, however, was determined
to declare war, and to secure support
the Chinese Premier summoned a council
of military governors to consider the question.
The majority of the conference agreed with
the Premier, but a vigorous opposition began
to develop. On May 7th the President sent a
formal request to Parliament to approve of a
declaration of war. Parliament delayed and
was threatened by a mob. The Premier was
accused of having instigated the riot and support
began to gather for Parliament, and an
attack was made on the Premier as being willing
to sell China.</p>

<p>Day by day the differences between the militants
and democrats became more bitter. The
question of war was almost lost in the differences
of opinion as to the comparative powers
of Parliament and the Executive. A demand
was made that the Premier resign. He refused
to resign and was dismissed from office by
the President, who was supported in his action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
by the Parliament. This was practically a
success of the Parliamentary party, when suddenly
several of the northern generals and
governors declared their independence, and the
movement gradually developed into a revolution
in favor of the restoration of the Manchu
Dynasty. This revolution was finally suppressed.</p>

<p>The Japanese declared themselves, not the
enemies, but the protectors of China in terms
that suggested the appearance of a Monroe
Doctrine for Asia. They pledged themselves
not to violate the political independence or territorial
integrity of China, and declared
strongly in favor of the principle of the open
door and equal opportunity.</p>

<p>On August 14th China formally joined the
Allies and declared war on Austria and Germany.
She took no great part in the war,
except to invade the German and Austrian
settlements in Tientsin and Hankow, which
were taken over by the Chinese authorities.
The Chinese officials also seized the Deutsche
Asiatische Bank which had been financing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
agent in China for the German Government,
and fourteen German vessels which had been
interned in Chinese ports. Thousands of Chinese
coolies were sent to Europe to work in the
Allied interests behind the battle lines, and
China has in all respects been faithful to her
pledges.</p>

<p>The official war proclamation of China which
was signed by President Feng-kuo-chang reviewed
China’s efforts to induce Germany to
modify her submarine policy. It declared that
China had been forced to sever relations with
Germany and with Austro-Hungary to protect
the lives and property of Chinese citizens.
It promised that China would respect the
Hague Convention, regarding the humane conduct
of the war, and asserted that China’s object
was to hasten peace.</p>

<p>On July 22d Siam officially entered the war
and all German and Austrian subjects were
interned and German ships seized. The
Prince of Songkla, brother of the reigning
monarch, declared that natural necessity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
moral pressure forced Siam into the war on
the side of the Entente. Neutrality had become
increasingly difficult, and it had become
apparent that freedom and justice in states
which were not strong from a military standpoint
were not to be secured through the policy
of the Central Powers. Sympathy for Belgium
and the popular aversion to Teutonic
methods had left no doubt as to the duty of
Siam. The motive of Siam had a curious fitness,
though there was a certain quaintness in
her expression of a desire to make, “the world
safe for democracy.”</p>

<p>The native name of Siam is Muang-Thai,
which means the Kingdom of the Free. Siam
is about as large as France, and has a population
of about eight millions. Its people, who
are of many shades of yellowish-brown, have
descended into this corner of Asia from the
highlands north of Burma and east of Tibet.
The tradition among these people was that the
further south they descended the shorter they
would grow, that when they reached the southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
plains they would be no larger than rabbits,
and that when they came to the sea they
would vanish altogether. As a fact the northern
tribes are much taller than the southern.</p>

<p>The original population of the Siamese peninsula
was a race of black dwarfs, remnants
of whom still dwell in caves and nests of palm
leaves, so shy that it is almost impossible to
catch a glimpse of them. The literary and religious
culture of Siam comes mainly from
southern India. Buddhism is the dominant religion,
but there are many Mohammedans also.</p>

<p>The accession of Siam to the ranks of the
Allies did not make any great difference from
a military point of view, but it was another
evidence of the general world feeling with regard
to the Germans and their encroachments
in all parts of the world. Germany had tried
its best to keep these nations from participation
in the war, but not only had her propaganda
failed but the feeling of these Oriental
peoples was strongly anti-German. Much of
this feeling, it is readily seen from their statements
and their private letters, comes from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
personal resentment of the boorish attitude of
the individual German. By the end of 1918
the Teuton influence in the Orient had completely
disappeared.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<span class="smcap">The Defeat and Recovery of Italy</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NONE of the surprises of the World War
brought such sudden and stunning dismay
to the Entente Allies as the news of the
Italian disaster beginning October 24, 1917,
and terminating in mid-November. It is a
story in which propaganda was an important
factor. It taught the Allies the dangers lying
in fraternization between opposing armies.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1917 the second Italian
Army was confronted by Austrian regiments
composed largely of war-weary Socialists.
During that summer skillful German
propagandists operating from Spain had sown
the seeds of pacificism throughout Italy. This
was made easy by the distress then existing
particularly in the villages where food was
scanty and complaints against the conduct of
the war were numerous. The propaganda extended
from the civilian population to the
army, and its channel was directed mainly toward
the Second Army encamped along the
Isonzo River.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THREE MESSENGERS OF DESTRUCTION FOR TRIESTE</p>

<p>This remarkable photograph was taken from one French airplane just as another had released three aerial torpedoes in a combined
bombing and observation raid on Trieste, the great Austrian naval base. The photograph itself, showing details of enemy activity on
the waterfront, was of considerable value to the intelligence division of the Italian army.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>As a consequence of the pacifists’ preachments
both by words of mouth and document,
the Second Army was ready for the friendly
approaches that came from the front lines of
the Austrians only a few hundred yards away.
Daily communication was established and at
night the opposing soldiers fraternized generally.
The Russian doctrine that an end of the
fighting would come if the soldiers agreed to do
no more shooting, spread throughout the Italian
trenches.</p>

<p>This was all part of a plan carefully mapped
out by the German High Command. When
the infection had spread, the fraternizing Austrian
troops were withdrawn from the front
trenches and German shock troops took their
places.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe42_5625" id="i_216">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Area of the Flow and Ebb of Italy’s Military Success</span><br>

From the Carso plateau to the Piave line.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On October 24th these troops attacked in
force. The Italians in the front line, mistaking
them for the friendly Austrians, waved a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
greeting. German machine guns and rifles
replied with a deadly fire, and the great flanking
movement commenced. So well had the
Germans played their game the Italians lost
more than 250,000 prisoners and 2,300 guns in
the first week. The attack began in the Julian
Alps and continued along the Isonzo southwestward
into the plain of Venice. The Italian
positions at Tolmino and Plezzo were captured
and the whole Italian force was compelled
to retreat along a seventy-mile front
from the Carnic Alps to the sea. The most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
important point gained by the enemy in its
early assault was the village of Caporetto on
the Upper Isonzo where General Cadorna held
a great series of dams which could have drained
the Isonzo River dry within twelve hours.</p>

<p>The Italian retreat at places degenerated
into a rout and it was not until the Italians,
reinforced by French and British, reached the
Piave River, that a stand was finally made.
The defeat cost Cadorna his command, and he
was succeeded by General Armando Diaz,
whose brilliant strategy during the remainder
of the war marked him as a national hero and
one of the outstanding military geniuses of the
war.</p>

<p>The order for a general retreat was issued on
October 27th. Poison gas shells rained blindness
and death upon the retreating Italians and
upon the heroic rear-guards. The city of
Udine and its environs were emptied of their
inhabitants; and Goritzia, which had been
wrested after a desperate effort from the Austrians,
was retaken on October 28th.</p>

<p>That the entire Italian army escaped the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
fate that had come to the Russians at the
Masurian Lakes was due mainly to the Third
Army commanded by the Duke of Aosta.
During the long running fight, it faced about
from time to time and drove the Germans back
in bloody encounters.</p>

<p>By November 10th the Italian forces had
come to the hastily prepared entrenchments
on the west bank of the Piave River. The
Austrians and the Germans dug in on the east
bank of the stream from the village of Susegana
in the Alpine foothills to the Adriatic
Sea.</p>

<p>Here a long-drawn-out battle was fought,
resulting in enormous losses to the Germans
and Austrians. By this time reinforcements
had come up from the French front and every
attempt by the enemy to gain ground met a
bloody check. The hardest fighting was on
the Asiago Plateau. There, although the
Italians were greatly outnumbered, the concentration
of their artillery in the hills overlooking
the great field completely dominated
the situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>A factor that was of the utmost value in
checking the Austrians was the system of
lagoon defenses running from the lower Piave
to the Gulf of Venice.</p>

<p>From November 13th, when the Austrians
in crossing the lower Piave in their headlong
rush to Venice were suddenly checked by the
Italian lagoon defenses, the entire Gulf of Venice,
with its endless canals and marshes, with
islands disappearing and reappearing with the
tide, was the scene of a continuous battle. A
correspondent described the fighting as absolutely
without precedent. The Teutons were
desperately trying to turn the Italian right
wing by working their way around the northern
limits of the Venetian Gulf. The Italians
inundated the region and sealed all the entrances
into the gulf by mine fields. The gulf,
therefore, was converted into an isolated sea.
Over this inland waterway the conflict raged
bitterly. The Italians had a “lagoon fleet”
ranging from the swiftest of motor boats,
armed with machine guns, small cannon, and
torpedo tubes, to huge, cumbersome, flat-bottomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
British monitors, mounting the biggest
guns.</p>

<p>The Italian vessels navigated secret channels
dug in the bottom of the shallow lagoons.
Only the Italian war pilots knew these courses.
Even gondolas straying out of the channels
were instantly and hopelessly stranded. Not
only this, but as the muddy flats and marshy
islands did not permit of artillery emplacements
the Italians developed an immense fleet
of floating batteries. The guns ranged from
three-inch fieldpieces to great fifteen-inch monsters.
Each was camouflaged to represent a
tiny island, a garden patch, or a houseboat.
Floating on the glasslike surface of the
lagoons, the guns fired a few shots and then
changed position, making it utterly impossible
for the enemy to locate them. The entire
auxiliary service of supplying this floating
army was adapted to meet the lagoon warfare.
Munition dumps were on boats, constantly
moved about to prevent the enemy spotting
them. Gondolas and motor boats replaced the
automobile supply lorries customary in land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
warfare. Instead of motor ambulances, motor
boats carried off the dead and wounded.
Hydro-airplanes replaced ordinary fighting
aircraft.</p>

<p>Along the northern limit of the Venetian
Gulf, where the Austrians, having filtered into
the Piave Delta, sought to cross both the Sile
and the Piave, the enemy each night hooked up
pontoons. At daybreak every morning one
end of a huge pontoon structure was anchored
to the east bank of the Piave and the other
flung out to the strong current, which soon
stretched the makeshift bridge across.</p>

<p>The moment this happened, the enemy infantry
madly dashed across. Simultaneously
the Italian floating batteries opened a terrific
fire. Practically every morning the Austrians
tried the trick, and every morning they failed,
with heavy losses, to effect a crossing. At last
they gave up the attempt as hopeless, and the
armies remained locked on the Piave for several
months.</p>
